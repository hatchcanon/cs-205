My \\nfingers stretch out, seeking Prim\\'s warmth but finding \\nonly the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She \\nmust have had bad dreams and climbed in with our \\nmother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the \\nreaping. \\n\\nI prop myself up on one elbow. There\\'s enough light in \\nthe bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled \\nup on her side, cocooned in my mother\\'s body, their \\ncheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks \\nyounger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim\\'s \\nface is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the \\nprimrose for which she was named. My mother was \\nvery beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me. \\n\\nSitting at Prim\\'s knees, guarding her, is the world\\'s \\nugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, \\neyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him \\nButtercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat \\nmatched the bright flower. I le hates me. Or at least \\ndistrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he \\nstill remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket \\nwhen Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly \\nswollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last \\nthing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim \\nbegged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It \\nturned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and \\nhe\\'s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. \\nSometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the \\nentrails. He has stopped hissing at me. \\n\\nEntrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever \\ncome to love. \\n\\n\\n\\n3 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting \\nboots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I \\npull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up \\ninto a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, \\nunder a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats \\nand cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese \\nwrapped in basil leaves. Prim\\'s gift to me on reaping \\nday. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip \\noutside. \\n\\nOur part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is \\nusually crawling with coal miners heading out to the \\nmorning shift at this hour. Men and women with \\nhunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who \\nhave long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust \\nout of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken \\nfaces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. \\nShutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The \\nreaping isn\\'t until two. May as well sleep in. If you \\ncan. \\n\\nOur house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only \\nhave to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field \\ncalled the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the \\nwoods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high \\nchain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In \\ntheory, it\\'s supposed to be electrified twenty-four \\nhours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live \\nin the woods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, \\nbears \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that used to threaten our streets. But since \\nwe\\'re lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in \\nthe evenings, it\\'s usually safe to touch. Even so, I \\nalways take a moment to listen carefully for the hum \\nthat means the fence is live. Right now, it\\'s silent as a \\nstone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out \\non my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that\\'s \\nbeen loose for years. There are several other weak \\nspots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I \\nalmost always enter the woods here. \\n\\n4 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as I\\'m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and \\nsheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, \\nthe fence has been successful at keeping the flesh- \\neaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam \\nfreely, and there are added concerns like venomous \\nsnakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. \\nBut there\\'s also food if you know how to find it. My \\nfather knew and he taught me some before he was \\nblown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing \\neven to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still \\nwake up screaming for him to run. \\n\\nEven though trespassing in the woods is illegal and \\npoaching carries the severest of penalties, more \\npeople would risk it if they had weapons. But most \\nare not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. \\nMy bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a \\nfew others that I keep well hidden in the woods, \\ncarefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father \\ncould have made good money selling them, but if the \\nofficials found out he would have been publicly \\nexecuted for inciting a rebellion. Most of the \\nPeacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who \\nhunt because they\\'re as hungry for fresh meat as \\nanybody is. In fact, they\\'re among our best \\ncustomers. But the idea that someone might be \\narming the Seam would never have been allowed. \\n\\nIn the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to \\nharvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. \\nAlways close enough to run back to the safety of \\nDistrict 12 if trouble arises. \"District Twelve. Where \\nyou can starve to death in safety,\" I mutter. Then I \\nglance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in \\nthe middle of nowhere, you worry someone might \\noverhear you. \\n\\nWhen I was younger, I scared my mother to death, \\nthe things I would blurt out about District 12, about \\n5 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe people who rule our country, Panem, from the far- \\noff city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood \\nthis would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned \\nto hold my tongue and to turn my features into an \\nindifferent mask so that no one could ever read my \\nthoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only \\npolite small talk in the public market. Discuss little \\nmore than trades in the Hob, which is the black \\nmarket where I make most of my money. Even at \\nhome, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing \\ntricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or \\nthe Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my \\nwords and then where would we be? \\n\\nIn the woods waits the only person with whom I can \\nbe myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face \\nrelaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to \\nour place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket \\nof berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The \\nsight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale \\nsays I never smile except in the woods. \\n\\n\"Hey, Catnip,\" says Gale. My real name is Katniss, \\nbut when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. \\nSo he thought I\\'d said Catnip. Then when this crazy \\nlynx started following me around the woods looking \\nfor handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I \\nfinally had to kill the lynx because he scared off \\ngame. I almost regretted it because he wasn\\'t bad \\ncompany. But I got a decent price for his pelt. \\n\\n\"Look what I shot,\" Gale holds up a loaf of bread with \\nan arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It\\'s real bakery \\nbread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our \\ngrain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the \\narrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, \\ninhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood \\nwith saliva. Fine bread like this is for special \\noccasions. \\n\\n\\n\\n6 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mm, still warm,\" I say. He must have been at the \\nbakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. \"What did \\nit cost you?\" \\n\\n\"Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling \\nsentimental this morning,\" says Gale. \"Even wished \\nme luck.\" \\n\\n\"Well, we all feel a little closer today, don\\'t we?\" I say, \\nnot even bothering to roll my eyes. \"Prim left us a \\ncheese.\" I pull it out. \\n\\nHis expression brightens at the treat. \"Thank you, \\nPrim. We\\'ll have a real feast.\" Suddenly he falls into a \\nCapitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the \\nmaniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to \\nread out the names at the leaping. \"I almost forgot! \\nHappy Hunger Games!\" He plucks a few blackberries \\nfrom the bushes around us. \"And may the odds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\nHe tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. \\n\\nI catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin \\nwith my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my \\ntongue. \" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 be ever in your favor!\" I finish with equal \\nverve. We have to joke about it because the \\nalternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, \\nthe Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything \\nsounds funny in it. \\n\\nI watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the \\nbread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, \\nolive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But we\\'re \\nnot related, at least not closely. Most of the families \\nwho work the mines resemble one another this way. \\n\\nThat\\'s why my mother and Prim, with their light hair \\nand blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My \\nmother\\'s parents were part of the small merchant \\nclass that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the \\n7 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\noccasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary \\nshop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no \\none can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. \\nMy father got to know my mother because on his \\nhunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs \\nand sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. \\nShe must have really loved him to leave her home for \\nthe Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is \\nthe woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while \\nher children turned to skin and bones. I try to forgive \\nher for my father\\'s sake. But to be honest, I\\'m not the \\nforgiving type. \\n\\nGale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat \\ncheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I \\nstrip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a \\nnook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible \\nbut have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming \\nwith summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish \\niridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a \\nblue sky and soft breeze. The food\\'s wonderful, with \\nthe cheese seeping into the warm bread and the \\nberries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be \\nperfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off \\nmeant was roaming the mountains with Gale, \\nhunting for tonight\\'s supper. But instead we have to \\nbe standing in the square at two o\\'clock waiting for \\nthe names to be called out. \\n\\n\"We could do it, you know,\" Gale says quietly. \\n\\n\"What?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You \\nand I, we could make it,\" says Gale. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how to respond. The idea is so \\npreposterous. \\n\\n\\n\\n8 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"If we didn\\'t have so many kids,\" he adds quickly. \\n\\nThey\\'re not our kids, of course. But they might as well \\nbe. Gale\\'s two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And \\nyou may as well throw in our mothers, too, because \\nhow would they live without us? Who would fill those \\nmouths that are always asking for more? With both of \\nus hunting daily, there are still nights when game has \\nto be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still \\nnights when we go to bed with our stomachs \\ngrowling. \\n\\n\"I never want to have kids,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I might. If I didn\\'t live here,\" says Gale. \\n\\n\"But you do,\" I say, irritated. \\n\\n\"Forget it,\" he snaps back. \\n\\nThe conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I \\nleave Prim, who is the only person in the world I\\'m \\ncertain I love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We \\ncan\\'t leave, so why bother talking about it? And even \\nif we did . . . even if we did . . . where did this stuff \\nabout having kids come from? There\\'s never been \\nanything romantic between Gale and me. When we \\nmet, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he \\nwas only two years older, he already looked like a \\nman. It took a long time for us to even become \\nfriends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin \\nhelping each other out. \\n\\nBesides, if he wants kids, Gale won\\'t have any trouble \\nfinding a wife. He\\'s good-looking, he\\'s strong enough \\nto handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. \\nYou can tell by the way the girls whisper about him \\nwhen he walks by in school that they want him. It \\n\\n\\n\\n9 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmakes me jealous but not for the reason people would \\nthink. Good hunting partners are hard to find. \\n\\n\"What do you want to do?\" I ask. We can hunt, fish, \\nor gather. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and \\ngather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\nTonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to \\ncelebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that \\ntheir children have been spared for another year. But \\nat least two families will pull their shutters, lock their \\ndoors, and try to figure out how they will survive the \\npainful weeks to come. \\n\\nWe make out well. The predators ignore us on a day \\nwhen easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, \\nwe have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, \\na gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a few years \\nago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around \\nit to keep out the animals. \\n\\nOn the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black \\nmarket that operates in an abandoned warehouse \\nthat once held coal. When they came up with a more \\nefficient system that transported the coal directly \\nfrom the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took \\nover the space. Most businesses are closed by this \\ntime on reaping day, but the black market\\'s still fairly \\nbusy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, \\nthe other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old \\nwoman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large \\nkettle, takes half the greens off our hands in \\nexchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might \\ndo a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to \\nkeep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She\\'s the only \\none who can consistently be counted on to buy wild \\n10 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndog. We don\\'t hunt them on purpose, but if you\\'re \\nattacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is \\nmeat. \"Once it\\'s in the soup, 111 call it beef,\" Greasy \\nSae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn \\nup their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the \\nPeacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a \\nlittle choosier. \\n\\nWhen we finish our business at the market, we go to \\nthe back door of the mayor\\'s house to sell half the \\nstrawberries, knowing he has a particular fondness \\nfor them and can afford our price. The mayor\\'s \\ndaughter, Madge, opens the door. She\\'s in my year at \\nschool. Being the mayor\\'s daughter, you\\'d expect her \\nto be a snob, but she\\'s all right. She just keeps to \\nherself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a \\ngroup of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at \\nschool. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at \\nassemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely \\ntalk, which suits us both just fine. \\n\\nToday her drab school outfit has been replaced by an \\nexpensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up \\nwith a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes. \\n\\n\"Pretty dress,\" says Gale. \\n\\nMadge shoots him a look, trying to see if it\\'s a \\ngenuine compliment or if he\\'s just being ironic. Itisa \\npretty dress, but she would never be wearing it \\nordinarily. She presses her lips together and then \\nsmiles. \"Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want \\nto look nice, don\\'t I?\" \\n\\nNow it\\'s Gale\\'s turn to be confused. Does she mean \\nit? Or is she messing with him? I\\'m guessing the \\nsecond. \\n\\n\\n\\n11 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You won\\'t be going to the Capitol,\" says Gale coolly. \\nHis eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her \\ndress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a \\nfamily in bread for months. \"What can you have? Five \\nentries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s not her fault,\" I say. \\n\\n\"No, it\\'s no one\\'s fault. Just the way it is,\" says Gale. \\nMadge\\'s face has become closed off. She puts the \\nmoney for the berries in my hand. \"Good luck, \\nKatniss.\" \"You, too,\" I say, and the door closes. \\n\\nWe walk toward the Seam in silence. I don\\'t like that \\nGale took a dig at Madge, but he\\'s right, of course. \\nThe reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting \\nthe worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the \\nday you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered \\nonce. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until \\nyou reach the age of eighteen, the final year of \\neligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven \\ntimes. That\\'s true for every citizen in all twelve \\ndistricts in the entire country of Panem. \\n\\nBut here\\'s the catch. Say you are poor and starving \\nas we were. You can opt to add your name more times \\nin exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a \\nmeager year\\'s supply of grain and oil for one person. \\nYou may do this for each of your family members as \\nwell. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered \\nfour times. Once, because I had to, and three times \\nfor tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my \\nmother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. \\nAnd the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of \\nsixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. \\nGale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or \\nsingle-handedly feeding a family of five for seven \\nyears, will have his name in forty-two times. \\n\\n\\n\\n12 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nYou can see why someone like Madge, who has never \\nbeen at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The \\nchance of her name being drawn is very slim \\ncompared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not \\nimpossible, but slim. And even though the rules were \\nset up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not \\nMadge\\'s family, it\\'s hard not to resent those who don\\'t \\nhave to sign up for tesserae. \\n\\nGale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On \\nother days, deep in the woods, I\\'ve listened to him \\nrant about how the tesserae are just another tool to \\ncause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred \\nbetween the starving workers of the Seam and those \\nwho can generally count on supper and thereby \\nensure we will never trust one another. \"It\\'s to the \\nCapitol\\'s advantage to have us divided among \\nourselves,\" he might say if there were no ears to hear \\nbut mine. If it wasn\\'t reaping day. If a girl with a gold \\npin and no tesserae had not made what I\\'m sure she \\nthought was a harmless comment. \\n\\nAs we walk, I glance over at Gale\\'s face, still \\nsmoldering underneath his stony expression. His \\nrages seem pointless to me, although I never say so. \\nIt\\'s not that I don\\'t agree with him. I do. But what \\ngood is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the \\nwoods? It doesn\\'t change anything. It doesn\\'t make \\nthings fair. It doesn\\'t fill our stomachs. In fact, it \\nscares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. \\nBetter he does it in the woods than in the district. \\n\\nGale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple \\nof loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of \\nstrawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for \\neach. \\n\\n\"See you in the square,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n13 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wear something pretty,\" he says flatly. \\n\\n\\n\\nAt home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. \\nMy mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary \\ndays. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and \\nruffled blouse. It\\'s a bit big on her, but my mother \\nhas made it stay with pins. Even so, she\\'s having \\ntrouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. \\n\\nA tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt \\nand sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To \\nmy surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own \\nlovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching \\nshoes. \\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" I ask. I\\'m trying to get past rejecting \\noffers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I \\nwouldn\\'t allow her to do anything for me. And this is \\nsomething special. Her clothes from her past are very \\nprecious to her. \\n\\n\"Of course. Let\\'s put your hair up, too,\" she says. I let \\nher towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can \\nhardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that \\nleans against the wall. \\n\\n\"You look beautiful,\" says Prim in a hushed voice. \\n\\n\"And nothing like myself,\" I say. I hug her, because I \\nknow these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her \\nfirst reaping. She\\'s about as safe as you can get, since \\nshe\\'s only entered once. I wouldn\\'t let her take out \\nany tesserae. But she\\'s worried about me. That the \\nunthinkable might happen. \\n\\nI protect Prim in every way I can, but I\\'m powerless \\nagainst the reaping. The anguish I always feel when \\nshe\\'s in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to \\nregister on my (ace. I notice her blouse has pulled out \\n14 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nof her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay \\ncalm. \"Tuck your tail in, little duck,\" I say, smoothing \\nthe blouse back in place. \\n\\nPrim giggles and gives me a small\"Quack.\" \\n\\n\"Quack yourself,\" I say with a light laugh. The kind \\nonly Prim can draw out of me. \"Come on, let\\'s eat,\" I \\nsay and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head. \\n\\nThe fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but \\nthat will be for supper. We decide to save the \\nstrawberries and bakery bread for this evening\\'s meal, \\nto make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from \\nPrim\\'s goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from \\nthe tessera grain, although no one has much appetite \\nanyway. \\n\\nAt one o\\'clock, we head for the square. Attendance is \\nmandatory unless you are on death\\'s door. This \\nevening, officials will come around and check to see if \\nthis is the case. If not, youll be imprisoned. \\n\\nIt\\'s too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the \\nsquare \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one of the few places in District 12 that can \\nbe pleasant. The square\\'s surrounded by shops, and \\non public market days, especially if there\\'s good \\nweather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite \\nthe bright banners hanging on the buildings, there\\'s \\nan air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like \\nbuzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. \\n\\nPeople file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a \\ngood opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the \\npopulation as well. Twelve- through eighteen-year- \\nolds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, \\nthe oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, \\ntoward the back. Family members line up around the \\nperimeter, holding tightly to one another\\'s hands. But \\n15 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthere are others, too, who have no one they love at \\nstake, or who no longer care, who slip among the \\ncrowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will \\nbe drawn. Odds are given on their ages, whether \\nthey\\'re Seam or merchant, if they will break down and \\nweep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but \\ncarefully, carefully. These same people tend to be \\ninformers, and who hasn\\'t broken the law? I could be \\nshot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of \\nthose in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim \\nthe same. \\n\\nAnyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose \\nbetween dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the \\nbullet would be much quicker. \\n\\nThe space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people \\narrive. The square\\'s quite large, but not enough to \\nhold District 12\\'s population of about eight thousand. \\nLatecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where \\nthey can watch the event on screens as it\\'s televised \\nlive by the state. \\n\\nI find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the \\nSeam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our \\nattention on the temporary stage that is set up before \\nthe Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, \\nand two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for \\nthe girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls\\' ball. \\nTwenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on \\nthem in careful handwriting. \\n\\nTwo of the three chairs fill with Madge\\'s father, Mayor \\nUndersee, who\\'s a tall, balding man, and Effie \\nTrinket, District 12\\'s escort, fresh from the Capitol \\nwith her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring \\ngreen suit. They murmur to each other and then look \\nwith concern at the empty seat. \\n\\n\\n\\n16 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nJust as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps \\nup to the podium and begins to read. It\\'s the same \\nstory every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the \\ncountry that rose up out of the ashes of a place that \\nwas once called North America. He lists the disasters, \\nthe droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching \\nseas that swallowed up so much of the land, the \\nbrutal war for what little sustenance remained. The \\nresult was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by \\nthirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity \\nto its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising \\nof the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were \\ndefeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of \\nTreason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace \\nand, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must \\nnever be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. \\n\\nThe rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In \\npunishment for the uprising, each of the twelve \\ndistricts must provide one girl and one boy, called \\ntributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will \\nbe imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold \\nanything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. \\nOver a period of several weeks, the competitors must \\nfight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. \\n\\nTaking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill \\none another while we watch \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this is the Capitol\\'s \\nway of reminding us how totally we are at their \\nmercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving \\nanother rebellion. \\n\\nWhatever words they use, the real message is \\nclear. \"Look how we take your children and sacrifice \\nthem and there\\'s nothing you can do. If you lift a \\nfinger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as \\nwe did in District Thirteen.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n17 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nTo make it humiliating as well as torturous, the \\nCapitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a \\nfestivity, a sporting event pitting every district against \\nthe others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease \\nback home, and their district will be showered with \\nprizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol \\nwill show the winning district gifts of grain and oil \\nand even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us \\nbattle starvation. \\n\\n\"It is both a time for repentance and a time for \\nthanks,\" intones the mayor. \\n\\nThen he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In \\nseventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one \\nis still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle- \\naged man, who at this moment appears hollering \\nsomething unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and \\nfalls into the third chair. He\\'s drunk. Very. The crowd \\nresponds with its token applause, but he\\'s confused \\nand tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she \\nbarely manages to fend off. \\n\\nThe mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being \\ntelevised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of \\nPanem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the \\nattention back to the reaping by introducing Effie \\nTrinket. \\n\\nBright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the \\npodium and gives her signature, \"Happy Hunger \\nGames! And may the odds be ever in your favor!\" Her \\npink hair must be a wig because her curls have \\nshifted slightly off-center since her encounter with \\nHaymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is \\nto be here, although everyone knows she\\'s just aching \\nto get bumped up to a better district where they have \\nproper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of \\nthe entire nation. \\n\\n\\n\\n18 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me \\nwith a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at \\nleast has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly I \\nam thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that \\nbig glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. \\nNot compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe he\\'s \\nthinking the same thing about me because his face \\ndarkens and he turns away. \"But there are still \\nthousands of slips,\" I wish I could whisper to him. \\n\\nIt\\'s time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she \\nalways does, \"Ladies first!\"and crosses to the glass \\nball with the girls\\' names. She reaches in, digs her \\nhand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. \\nThe crowd draws in a collective breath and then you \\ncan hear a pin drop, and I\\'m feeling nauseous and so \\ndesperately hoping that it\\'s not me, that it\\'s not me, \\nthat it\\'s not me. \\n\\nEffie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes \\nthe slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear \\nvoice. And it\\'s not me. \\n\\nIt\\'s Primrose Everdeen. \\n\\n\\n\\n19 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nOne time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting \\nmotionless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell \\nten feet to the ground, landing on my back. It was as \\nif the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my \\nlungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, \\nto do anything. \\n\\nThat\\'s how I feel now, trying to remember how to \\nbreathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name \\nbounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is \\ngripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and I think \\nmaybe I started to fall and he caught me. \\n\\nThere must have been some mistake. This can\\'t be \\nhappening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! \\nHer chances of being chosen so remote that I\\'d not \\neven bothered to worry about her. Hadn\\'t I done \\neverything? Taken the tesserae, refused to let her do \\nthe same? One slip. One slip in thousands. The odds \\nhad been entirely in her favor. But it hadn\\'t mattered. \\n\\nSomewhere far away, I can hear the crowd \\nmurmuring unhappily as they always do when a \\ntwelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks \\nthis is fair. And then I see her, the blood drained from \\nher face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking \\nwith stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing \\nme, and I see the back of her blouse has become \\nuntucked and hangs out over her skirt. It\\'s this \\ndetail, the untucked blouse forming a ducktail, that \\nbrings me back to myself. \\n\\n\"Prim!\" The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and \\nmy muscles begin to move again. \"Prim!\" I don\\'t need \\n\\n\\n\\n20 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nto shove through the crowd. The other kids make way \\nimmediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. \\nI reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. \\nWith one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me. \\n\\n\"I volunteer!\" I gasp. \"I volunteer as tribute!\" \\n\\nThere\\'s some confusion on the stage. District 12 \\nhasn\\'t had a volunteer in decades and the protocol \\nhas become rusty. The rule is that once a tribute\\'s \\nname has been pulled from the ball, another eligible \\nboy, if a boy\\'s name has been read, or girl, if a girl\\'s \\nname has been read, can step forward to take his or \\nher place. In some districts, in which winning the \\nreaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk \\ntheir lives, the volunteering is complicated. But in \\nDistrict 12, where the wordtribute is pretty much \\nsynonymous with the word corpse, volunteers are all \\nbut extinct. \\n\\n\"Lovely!\" says Effie Trinket. \"But I believe there\\'s a \\nsmall matter of introducing the reaping winner and \\nthen asking for volunteers, and if one does come forth \\nthen we, um ...\" she trails off, unsure herself. \\n\\n\"What does it matter?\" says the mayor. He\\'s looking \\nat me with a pained expression on his face. He \\ndoesn\\'t know me really, but there\\'s a faint recognition \\nthere. I am the girl who brings the strawberries. The \\ngirl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. \\nThe girl who five years ago stood huddled with her \\nmother and sister, as he presented her, the oldest \\nchild, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, \\nvaporized in the mines. Does he remember that? \\n\"What does it matter?\" he repeats gruffly. \"Let her \\ncome forward.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n21 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPrim is screaming hysterically behind me. She\\'s \\nwrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice. \"No, \\nKatniss! No! You can\\'t go!\" \\n\\n\"Prim, let go,\" I say harshly, because this is upsetting \\nme and I don\\'t want to cry. When they televise the \\nreplay of the reapings tonight, everyone will make \\nnote of my tears, and I\\'ll be marked as an easy target. \\nA weakling. I will give no one that satisfaction. \"Let \\ngo!\" \\n\\nI can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn \\nand see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and she\\'s \\nthrashing in his arms. \"Up you go, Catnip,\" he says, \\nin a voice he\\'s fighting to keep steady, and then he \\ncarries Prim off toward my mother. I steel myself and \\nclimb the steps. \\n\\n\"Well, bravo!\" gushes Effie Trinket. \"That\\'s the spirit \\nof the Games!\" She\\'s pleased to finally have a district \\nwith a little action going on in it. \"What\\'s your name?\" \\n\\nI swallow hard. \"Katniss Everdeen,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I bet my buttons that was your sister. Don\\'t want her \\nto steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! \\nLet\\'s give a big round of applause to our newest \\ntribute!\" trills Effie Trinket. \\n\\nTo the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, \\nnot one person claps. Not even the ones holding \\nbetting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. \\nPossibly because they know me from the Hob, or \\nknew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no \\none can help loving. So instead of acknowledging \\napplause, I stand there unmoving while they take part \\nin the boldest form of dissent they can manage. \\nSilence. Which says we do not agree. We do not \\ncondone. All of this is wrong. \\n\\n22 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThen something unexpected happens. At least, I don\\'t \\nexpect it because I don\\'t think of District 12 as a \\nplace that cares about me. But a shift has occurred \\nsince I stepped up to take Prim\\'s place, and now it \\nseems I have become someone precious. At first one, \\nthen another, then almost every member of the crowd \\ntouches the three middle fingers of their left hand to \\ntheir lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and \\nrarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen \\nat funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it \\nmeans good-bye to someone you love. \\n\\nNow I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately \\nHaymitch chooses this time to come staggering across \\nthe stage to congratulate me. \"Look at her. Look at \\nthis one!\" he hollers, throwing an arm around my \\nshoulders. He\\'s surprisingly strong for such a wreck. \\n\"I like her!\" His breath reeks of liquor and it\\'s been a \\nlong time since he\\'s bathed. \"Lots of ...\" He can\\'t \\nthink of the word for a while. \"Spunk!\" he says \\ntriumphantly. \"More than you!\" he releases me and \\nstarts for the front of the stage. \"More than you!\" he \\nshouts, pointing directly into a camera. \\n\\nIs he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he \\nmight actually be taunting the Capitol? I\\'ll never \\nknow because just as he\\'s opening his mouth to \\ncontinue, Haymitch plummets off the stage and \\nknocks himself unconscious. \\n\\nHe\\'s disgusting, but I\\'m grateful. With every camera \\ngleefully trained on him, I have just enough time to \\nrelease the small, choked sound in my throat and \\ncompose myself. I put my hands behind my back and \\nstare into the distance. \\n\\nI can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale. \\nFor a moment, I yearn for something . . . the idea of us \\nleaving the district . . . making our way in the woods . . . \\n23 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nbut I know I was right about not running off. Because \\nwho else would have volunteered for Prim? \\n\\nHaymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie \\nTrinket is trying to get the ball rolling again. \"What an \\nexciting day!\" she warbles as she attempts to \\nstraighten her wig, which has listed severely to the \\nright. \"But more excitement to come! It\\'s time to \\nchoose our boy tribute!\" Clearly hoping to contain her \\ntenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her \\nhead as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys\\' \\nnames and grabs the first slip she encounters. She \\nzips back to the podium, and I don\\'t even have time to \\nwish for Gale\\'s safety when she\\'s reading the name. \\n\"Peeta Mellark.\" \\n\\nPeeta Mellark! \\n\\nOh, no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this \\nname, although I have never spoken directly to its \\nowner. Peeta Mellark. \\n\\nNo, the odds are not in my favor today. I watch him \\nas he makes his way toward the stage. Medium \\nheight, stocky build, ashy blond hair that falls in \\nwaves over \\n\\nhis forehead. The shock of the moment is registering \\non his face, you can see his struggle to remain \\nemotionless, but his blue eyes show the alarm I\\'ve \\nseen so often in prey. Yet he climbs steadily onto the \\nstage and takes his place. \\n\\nEffie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps \\nforward. He has two older brothers, I know, I\\'ve seen \\nthem in the bakery, but one is probably too old now \\nto volunteer and the other won\\'t. This is standard. \\nFamily devotion only goes so far for most people on \\nreaping day. What I did was the radical thing. \\n24 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of \\nTreason as he does every year at this point \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s \\nrequired \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but I\\'m not listening to a word. \\n\\nWhy him? I think. Then I try to convince myself it \\ndoesn\\'t matter. Peeta Mellark and I are not friends. \\nNot even neighbors. We don\\'t speak. Our only real \\ninteraction happened years ago. He\\'s probably \\nforgotten it. But I haven\\'t and I know I never will... . \\n\\nIt was during the worst time. My father had been \\nkilled in the mine accident three months earlier in the \\nbitterest January anyone could remember. The \\nnumbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would \\nhit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my \\nbody with sobs. Where are you? I would cry out in my \\nmind. Where have you gone? Of course, there was \\nnever any answer. \\n\\nThe district had given us a small amount of money as \\ncompensation for his death, enough to cover one \\nmonth of grieving at which time my mother would be \\nexpected to get a job. Only she didn\\'t. She didn\\'t do \\nanything but sit propped up in a chair or, more often, \\nhuddled under the blankets on her bed, eyes fixed on \\nsome point in the distance. Once in a while, she\\'d \\nstir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only \\nto then collapse back into stillness. No amount of \\npleading from Prim seemed to affect her. \\n\\nI was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was \\nlocked in some dark world of sadness, but at the \\ntime, all I knew was that I had lost not only a father, \\nbut a mother as well. At eleven years old, with Prim \\njust seven, I took over as head of the family. There \\nwas no choice. I bought our food at the market and \\ncooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and \\nmyself looking presentable. Because if it had become \\nknown that my mother could no longer care for us, \\n\\n25 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe district would have taken us away from her and \\nplaced us in the community home. I\\'d grown up \\nseeing those home kids at school. The sadness, the \\nmarks of angry hands on their faces, the \\nhopelessness that curled their shoulders forward. I \\ncould never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim \\nwho cried when I cried before she even knew the \\nreason, who brushed and plaited my mother\\'s hair \\nbefore we left for school, who still polished my father\\'s \\nshaving mirror each night because he\\'d hated the \\nlayer of coal dust that settled on everything in the \\nSeam. The community home would crush her like a \\nbug. So I kept our predicament a secret. \\n\\nBut the money ran out and we were slowly starving to \\ndeath. There\\'s no other way to put it. I kept telling \\nmyself if I could only hold out until May, just May \\n8th, I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the \\ntesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed \\nus. Only there were still several weeks to go. We could \\nwell be dead by then. \\n\\nStarvation\\'s not an uncommon fate in District 12. \\nWho hasn\\'t seen the victims? Older people who can\\'t \\nwork. Children from a family with too many to feed. \\nThose injured in the mines. Straggling through the \\nstreets. And one day, you come upon them sitting \\nmotionless against a wall or lying in the Meadow, you \\nhear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers \\nare called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never \\nthe cause of death officially. It\\'s always the flu, or \\nexposure, or pneumonia. But that fools no one. \\n\\nOn the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, \\nthe rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had \\nbeen in town, trying to trade some threadbare old \\nbaby clothes of Prim\\'s in the public market, but there \\nwere no takers. Although I had been to the Hob on \\nseveral occasions with my father, I was too frightened \\n26 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nto venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain \\nhad soaked through my father\\'s hunting jacket, \\nleaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, we\\'d \\nhad nothing but boiled water with some old dried \\nmint leaves I\\'d found in the back of a cupboard. By \\nthe time the market closed, I was shaking so hard I \\ndropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle. \\nI didn\\'t pick it up for fear I would keel over and be \\nunable to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted \\nthose clothes. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t go home. Because at home was my mother \\nwith her dead eyes and my little sister, with her \\nhollow cheeks and cracked lips. I couldn\\'t walk into \\nthat room with the smoky fire from the damp \\nbranches I had scavenged at the edge of the woods \\nafter the coal had run out, my bands empty of any \\nhope. \\n\\nI found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind \\nthe shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The \\nmerchants live above their businesses, so I was \\nessentially in their backyards. I remember the \\noutlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring, \\na goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a post, \\nhunched defeated in the muck. \\n\\nAll forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. \\nPunishable by death. But it crossed my mind that \\nthere might be something in the trash bins, and those \\nwere fair game. Perhaps a bone at the butcher\\'s or \\nrotted vegetables at the grocer\\'s, something no one \\nbut my family was desperate enough to eat. \\nUnfortunately, the bins had just been emptied. \\n\\nWhen I passed the baker\\'s, the smell of fresh bread \\nwas so overwhelming I felt dizzy. The ovens were in \\nthe back, and a golden glow spilled out the open \\nkitchen door. I stood mesmerized by the heat and the \\n27 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nluscious scent until the rain interfered, running its \\nicy fingers down my back, forcing me back to life. I \\nlifted the lid to the baker\\'s trash bin and found it \\nspotlessly, heartlessly bare. \\n\\nSuddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked \\nup to see the baker\\'s wife, telling me to move on and \\ndid I want her to call the Peacekeepers and how sick \\nshe was of having those brats from the Seam pawing \\nthrough her trash. The words were ugly and I had no \\ndefense. As I carefully replaced the lid and backed \\naway, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering out \\nfrom behind his mother\\'s back. I\\'d seen him at \\nschool. He was in my year, but I didn\\'t know his \\nname. He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? \\nHis mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but \\nhe must have been watching me as I made my way \\nbehind the pen that held their pig and leaned against \\nthe far side of an old apple tree. The realization that \\nI\\'d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My \\nknees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its \\nroots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and \\ntired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and \\ntake us to the community home, I thought. Or better \\nyet, let me die right here in the rain. \\n\\nThere was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the \\nwoman screaming again and the sound of a blow, and \\nI vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed \\ntoward me through the mud and I thought, It\\'s her. \\nShe\\'s coming to drive me away with a stick. But it \\nwasn\\'t her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried two \\nlarge loaves of bread that must have fallen into the \\nfire because the crusts were scorched black. \\n\\nHis mother was yelling, \"Feed it to the pig, you stupid \\ncreature! Why not? No one decent will buy burned \\nbread!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n28 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHe began to tear off chunks from the burned parts \\nand toss them into the trough, and the front bakery \\nbell rung and the mother disappeared to help a \\ncustomer. \\n\\nThe boy never even glanced my way, but I was \\nwatching him. Because of the bread, because of the \\nred weal that stood out on his cheekbone. What had \\nshe hit him with? \\n\\nMy parents never hit us. I couldn\\'t even imagine it. \\nThe boy took one look back to the bakery as if \\nchecking that the coast was clear, then, his attention \\nback on the pig, he threw a loaf of bread in my \\ndirection. The second quickly followed, and he \\nsloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door \\ntightly behind him. \\n\\nI stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, \\nperfect really, except for the burned areas. Did he \\nmean for me to have them? He must have. Because \\nthere they were at my feet. Before anyone could \\nwitness what had happened I shoved the loaves up \\nunder my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly \\nabout me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the \\nbread burned into my skin, but I clutched it tighter, \\nclinging to life. \\n\\nBy the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled \\nsomewhat, but the insides were still warm. When I \\ndropped them on the table, Prim\\'s hands reached to \\ntear off a chunk, but I made her sit, forced my mother \\nto join us at the table, and poured warm tea. I \\nscraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread. We \\nate an entire loaf, slice by slice. It was good hearty \\nbread, filled with raisins and nuts. \\n\\nI put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, \\nand fell into a dreamless sleep. It didn\\'t occur to me \\n29 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nuntil the next morning that the boy might have \\nburned the bread on purpose. Might have dropped \\nthe loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being \\npunished, and then delivered them to me. But I \\ndismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why \\nwould he have done it? He didn\\'t even know me. Still, \\njust throwing me the bread was an enormous \\nkindness that would have surely resulted in a beating \\nif discovered. 1 couldn\\'t explain his actions. \\n\\nWe ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to \\nschool. It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm \\nsweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, I passed the boy in \\nthe hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had \\nblackened. He was with his friends and didn\\'t \\nacknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim \\nand started for home that afternoon, I found him \\nstaring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes \\nmet for only a second, then he turned his head away. \\nI dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and that\\'s when I \\nsaw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off \\nin my head. I thought of the hours spent in the woods \\nwith my father and I knew how we were going to \\nsurvive. \\n\\nTo this day, I can never shake the connection between \\nthis boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me \\nhope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was \\nnot doomed. And more than once, I have turned in \\nthe school hallway and caught his eyes trained on \\nme, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him \\nsomething, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had \\nthanked him at some point, I\\'d be feeling less \\nconflicted now. I thought about it a couple of times, \\nbut the opportunity never seemed to present itself. \\nAnd now it never will. Because we\\'re going to be \\nthrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly \\nhow am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? \\n\\n\\n\\n30 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nSomehow it just won\\'t seem sincere if I\\'m trying to slit \\nhis throat. \\n\\nThe mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and \\nmotions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as \\nsolid and warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks \\nme right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is \\nmeant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe it\\'s just a \\nnervous spasm. \\n\\nWe turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of \\nPanem plays. \\n\\nOh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds \\nare someone else will kill him before I do. \\n\\nOf course, the odds have not been very dependable of \\nlate. \\n\\n\\n\\n31 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe moment the anthem ends, we are taken into \\ncustody. I don\\'t mean we\\'re handcuffed or anything, \\nbut a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the \\nfront door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes \\nhave tried to escape in the past. I\\'ve never seen that \\nhappen though. \\n\\nOnce inside, I\\'m conducted to a room and left alone. \\nIt\\'s the richest place I\\'ve ever been in, with thick, deep \\ncarpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet \\nbecause my mother has a dress with a collar made of \\nthe stuff. When I sit on the couch, I can\\'t help \\nrunning my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps \\nto calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The \\ntime allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their \\nloved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this \\nroom with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an \\noption. There will be more cameras at the train \\nstation. \\n\\nMy sister and my mother come first. I reach out to \\nPrim and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my \\nneck, head on my shoulder, just like she did when \\nshe was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and \\nwraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say \\nnothing. Then I start telling them all the things they \\nmust remember to do, now that I will not be there to \\ndo them for them. \\n\\nPrim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if \\nthey\\'re careful, on selling Prim\\'s goat milk and cheese \\nand the small apothecary business my mother now \\nruns for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the \\nherbs she doesn\\'t grow herself, but she must be very \\n\\n\\n\\n32 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncareful to describe them because he\\'s not as familiar \\nwith them as I am. He\\'ll also bring them game \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he \\nand I made a pact about this a year or so ago \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and \\nwill probably not ask for compensation, but they \\nshould thank him with some kind of trade, like milk \\nor medicine. \\n\\nI don\\'t bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to \\nteach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The \\nwoods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, \\nshe\\'d get teary and talk about how we might be able \\nto heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she \\nmakes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on \\nthat. \\n\\nWhen I am done with instructions about fuel, and \\ntrading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother \\nand grip her arm, hard. \"Listen to me. Are you \\nlistening to me?\" She nods, alarmed by my intensity. \\nShe must know what\\'s coming. \"You can\\'t leave \\nagain,\" I say. \\n\\nMy mother\\'s eyes find the floor. \"I know. I won\\'t. I \\ncouldn\\'t help what \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"Well, you have to help it this time. You can\\'t clock \\nout and leave Prim on her own. There\\'s no me now to \\nkeep you both alive. It doesn\\'t matter what happens. \\nWhatever you see on the screen. You have to promise \\nme you\\'ll fight through it!\" My voice has risen to a \\nshout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her \\nabandonment. \\n\\nShe pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger \\nherself now. \"I was ill. I could have treated myself if \\nI\\'d had the medicine I have now.\" \\n\\nThat part about her being ill might be true. I\\'ve seen \\n\\nher bring back people suffering from immobilizing \\n\\n33 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but it\\'s one \\nwe can\\'t afford. \\n\\n\"Then take it. And take care of her!\" I say. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be all right, Katniss,\" says Prim, clasping my face \\nin her hands. \"But you have to take care, too. You\\'re \\nso fast and brave. Maybe you can win.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t win. Prim must know that in her heart. The \\ncompetition will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from \\nwealthier districts, where winning is a huge honor, \\nwho\\'ve been trained their whole lives for this. Boys \\nwho are two to three times my size. Girls who know \\ntwenty different ways to kill you with a knife. Oh, \\nthereH be people like me, too. People to weed out \\nbefore the real fun begins. \\n\\n\"Maybe,\" I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to \\ncarry on if I\\'ve already given up myself. Besides, it \\nisn\\'t in my nature to go down without a fight, even \\nwhen things seem insurmountable. \"Then we\\'d be \\nrich as Haymitch.\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t care if we\\'re rich. I just want you to come \\nhome. You will try, won\\'t you? Really, really try?\" asks \\nPrim. \\n\\n\"Really, really try. I swear it,\" I say. And I know, \\nbecause of Prim, I\\'ll have to. \\n\\nAnd then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our \\ntime is up, and we\\'re all hugging one another so hard \\nit hurts and all I\\'m saying is \"I love you. I love you \\nboth.\" And they\\'re saying it back and then the \\nPeacekeeper orders them out and the door closes. I \\nbury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this \\ncan block the whole thing out. \\n\\n\\n\\n34 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nSomeone else enters the room, and when I look up, \\nI\\'m surprised to see it\\'s the baker, Peeta Mellark\\'s \\nfather. I can\\'t believe he\\'s come to visit me. After all, \\nI\\'ll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each \\nother a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she \\nsells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of \\nthem aside for him and he gives her a generous \\namount of bread in return. We always wait to trade \\nwith him when his witch of a wife isn\\'t around \\nbecause he\\'s so much nicer. I feel certain he would \\nnever have hit his son the way she did over the \\nburned bread. But why has he come to see me? \\n\\nThe baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the \\nplush chairs. He\\'s a big, broad-shouldered man with \\nburn scars from years at the ovens. He must have \\njust said goodbye to his son. \\n\\nHe pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket \\nand holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. \\nThese are a luxury we can never afford. \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" I say. The baker\\'s not a very talkative \\nman in the best of times, and today he has no words \\nat all. \"I had some of your bread this morning. My \\nfriend Gale gave you a squirrel for it.\" He nods, as if \\nremembering the squirrel. \"Not your best trade,\" I say. \\nHe shrugs as if it couldn\\'t possibly matter. \\n\\nThen I can\\'t think of anything else, so we sit in silence \\nuntil a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and \\ncoughs to clear his throat. \"Ill keep an eye on the \\nlittle girl. Make sure she\\'s eating.\" \\n\\nI feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his \\nwords. People deal with me, but they are genuinely \\nfond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to \\nkeep her alive. \\n\\n\\n\\n35 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nMy next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks \\nstraight to me. She is not weepy or evasive, instead \\nthere\\'s an urgency about her tone that surprises me. \\n\"They let you wear one thing from your district in the \\narena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you \\nwear this?\" She holds out the circular gold pin that \\nwas on her dress earlier. I hadn\\'t paid much attention \\nto it before, but now I see it\\'s a small bird in flight. \\n\\n\"Your pin?\" I say. Wearing a token from my district is \\nabout the last thing on my mind. \\n\\n\"Here, I\\'ll put it on your dress, all right?\" Madge \\ndoesn\\'t wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes \\nthe bird to my dress. \"Promise youll wear it into the \\narena, Katniss?\" she asks. \"Promise?\" \\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say. Cookies. A pin. I\\'m getting all kinds of \\ngifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the \\ncheek. Then she\\'s gone and I\\'m left thinking that \\nmaybe Madge really has been my friend all along. \\n\\nFinally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing \\nromantic between us, but when he opens his arms I \\ndon\\'t hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to \\nme \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, \\neven the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet \\nmoments on a hunt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but this is the first time I \\nreally feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own. \\n\\n\"Listen,\" he says. \"Getting a knife should be pretty \\neasy, but you\\'ve got to get your hands on a bow. \\nThat\\'s your best chance.\" \\n\\n\"They don\\'t always have bows,\" I say, thinking of the \\nyear there were only horrible spiked maces that the \\ntributes had to bludgeon one another to death with. \\n\\n\\n\\n36 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then make one,\" says Gale. \"Even a weak bow is \\nbetter than no bow at all.\" \\n\\nI have tried copying my father\\'s bows with poor \\nresults. It\\'s not that easy. Even he had to scrap his \\nown work sometimes. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t even know if there\\'ll be wood,\" I say. Another \\nyear, they tossed everybody into a landscape of \\nnothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I \\nparticularly hated that year. Many contestants were \\nbitten by venomous snakes or went insane from \\nthirst. \\n\\n\"There\\'s almost always some wood,\" Gale says. \"Since \\nthat year half of them died of cold. Not much \\nentertainment in that.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the \\nplayers freeze to death at night. You could hardly see \\nthem because they were just huddled in balls and \\nhad no wood for fires or torches or anything. It was \\nconsidered very anti-climactic in the Capitol, all those \\nquiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, there\\'s usually \\nbeen wood to make fires. \\n\\n\"Yes, there\\'s usually some,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Katniss, it\\'s just hunting. You\\'re the best hunter I \\nknow,\" says Gale. \\n\\n\"It\\'s not just hunting. They\\'re armed. They think,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"So do you. And you\\'ve had more practice. Real \\npractice,\" he says. \"You know how to kill.\" \\n\\n\"Not people,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n37 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"How different can it be, really?\" says Gale grimly. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe awful thing is that if I can forget they\\'re people, it \\nwill be no different at all. \\n\\nThe Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for \\nmore time, but they\\'re taking him away and I start to \\npanic. \"Don\\'t let them starve!\" I cry out, clinging to \\nhis hand. \\n\\n\"I won\\'t! You know I won\\'t! Katniss, remember I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he \\nsays, and they yank us apart and slam the door and \\n111 never know what it was he wanted me to \\nremember. \\n\\nIt\\'s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train \\nstation. I\\'ve never been in a car before. Rarely even \\nridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot. \\n\\nI\\'ve been right not to cry. The station is swarming \\nwith reporters with their insectlike cameras trained \\ndirectly on my face. But I\\'ve had a lot of practice at \\nwiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I \\ncatch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on \\nthe wall that\\'s airing my arrival live and feel gratified \\nthat I appear almost bored. \\n\\nPeeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been \\ncrying and interestingly enough does not seem to be \\ntrying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will \\nbe his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and \\nfrightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no \\ncompetition at all, and then come out fighting. This \\nworked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from \\nDistrict 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a \\nsniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about \\nher until there were only a handful of contestants left. \\nIt turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the \\nway she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for \\n\\n\\n\\n38 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta Mellark because he\\'s a baker\\'s son. All those \\nyears of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays \\naround have made him broad-shouldered and strong. \\nIt will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone \\nto overlook him. \\n\\nWe have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of \\nthe train while the cameras gobble up our images, \\nthen we\\'re allowed inside and the doors close \\nmercifully behind us. The train begins to move at \\nonce. \\n\\nThe speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, \\nI\\'ve never been on a train, as travel between the \\ndistricts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned \\nduties. For us, that\\'s mainly transporting coal. But \\nthis is no ordinary coal train. It\\'s one of the high- \\nspeed Capitol models that average 250 miles per \\nhour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a \\nday. \\n\\nIn school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place \\nonce called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region \\nknown is Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, \\nthey mined coal here. Which is why our miners have \\nto dig so deep. \\n\\nSomehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides \\nbasic reading and math most of our instruction is \\ncoal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the \\nhistory of Panem. It\\'s mostly a lot of blather about \\nwhat we owe the Capitol. I know there must be more \\nthan they\\'re telling us, an actual account of what \\nhappened during the rebellion. But I don\\'t spend \\nmuch time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I \\ndon\\'t see how it will help me get food on the table. \\n\\nThe tribute train is fancier than even the room in the \\n\\nJustice Building. We are each given our own \\n\\n39 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nchambers that have a bedroom, a dressing area, and \\na private bathroom with hot and cold running water. \\nWe don\\'t have hot water at home, unless we boil it. \\n\\nThere are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie \\nTrinket tells me to do anything I want, wear anything \\nI want, everything is at my disposal. Just be ready for \\nsupper in an hour. I peel off my mother\\'s blue dress \\nand take a hot shower. I\\'ve never had a shower \\nbefore. It\\'s like being in a summer rain, only warmer. \\nI dress in a dark green shirt and pants. \\n\\nAt the last minute, I remember Madge\\'s little gold pin. \\nFor the first time, I get a good look at it. It\\'s as if \\nsomeone fashioned a small golden bird and then \\nattached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the \\nring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A \\nmockingj ay. \\n\\nThey\\'re funny birds and something of a slap in the \\nface to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol \\nbred a series of genetically altered animals as \\nweapons. The common term for them was muttations, \\nor sometimesmuttsfor short. One was a special bird \\ncalled a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize \\nand repeat whole human conversations. They were \\nhoming birds, exclusively male, that were released \\ninto regions where the Capitol\\'s enemies were known \\nto be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they\\'d fly \\nback to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile \\nto realize what was going on in the districts, how \\nprivate conversations were being transmitted. Then, \\nof course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and \\nthe joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and \\nthe birds were abandoned to die off in the wild. \\n\\nOnly they didn\\'t die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated \\nwith female mockingbirds creating a whole new \\nspecies that could replicate both bird whistles and \\n40 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nhuman melodies. They had lost the ability to \\nenunciate words but could still mimic a range of \\nhuman vocal sounds, from a child\\'s high-pitched \\nwarble to a man\\'s deep tones. And they could re- \\ncreate songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs \\nwith multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing \\nthem and if they liked your voice. \\n\\nMy father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When \\nwe went hunting, he would whistle or sing \\ncomplicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, \\nthey\\'d always sing back. Not everyone is treated with \\nsuch respect. But whenever my father sang, all the \\nbirds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice \\nwas that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with \\nlife it made you want to laugh and cry at the same \\ntime. I could never bring myself to continue the \\npractice after he was gone. Still, there\\'s something \\ncomforting about the little bird. It\\'s like having a piece \\nof my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin \\nonto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a \\nbackground, I can almost imagine the mockingjay \\nflying through the trees. \\n\\nEffie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow \\nher through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining \\nroom with polished paneled walls. There\\'s a table \\nwhere all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta \\nMellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him \\nempty. \\n\\n\"Where\\'s Haymitch?\" asks Effie Trinket brightly. \\n\\n\"Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a \\nnap,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s been an exhausting day,\" says Effie Trinket. \\nI think she\\'s relieved by Haymitch \\'s absence, and who \\ncan blame her? \\n\\n\\n\\n41 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, \\ngreen salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese \\nand fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, \\nEffie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space \\nbecause there\\'s more to come. But I\\'m stuffing myself \\nbecause I\\'ve never had food like this, so good and so \\nmuch, and because probably the best thing I can do \\nbetween now and the Games is put on a few pounds. \\n\\n\"At least, you two have decent manners,\" says Effie as \\nwe\\'re finishing the main course. \"The pair last year \\nate everything with their hands like a couple of \\nsavages. It completely upset my digestion.\" \\n\\nThe pair last year were two kids from the Seam who\\'d \\nnever, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. \\nAnd when they did have food, table manners were \\nsurely the last thing on their minds. Peeta\\'s a baker\\'s \\nson. My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly, so \\nyes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie \\nTrinket\\'s comment so much I make a point of eating \\nthe rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my \\nhands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her \\nlips tightly together. \\n\\nNow that the meal\\'s over, I\\'m fighting to keep the food \\ndown. I can see Peeta\\'s looking a little green, too. \\nNeither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But \\nif I can hold down Greasy Sae\\'s concoction of mice \\nmeat, pig entrails, and tree bark \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a winter specialty \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\'m determined to hang on to this. \\n\\nWe go to another compartment to watch the recap of \\nthe reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them \\nthroughout the day so a person could conceivably \\nwatch the whole thing live, but only people in the \\nCapitol could really do that, since none of them have \\nto attend reapings themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n42 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nOne by one, we see the other reapings, the names \\ncalled, (the volunteers stepping forward or, more \\noften, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will \\nbe our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A \\nmonstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from \\nDistrict 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from \\nDistrict 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. \\nAnd most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from \\nDistrict 1 1 . She has dark brown skin and eyes, but \\nother than that, she\\'s very like Prim in size and \\ndemeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they \\nask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind \\nwhistling through the decrepit buildings around her. \\nThere\\'s no one willing to take her place. \\n\\nLast of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, \\nme running forward to volunteer. You can\\'t miss the \\ndesperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as \\nif I\\'m afraid no one will hear and they 11 take Prim \\naway. But, of course, they do hear. I see Gale pulling \\nher off me and watch myself mount the stage. The \\ncommentators are not sure what to say about the \\ncrowd\\'s refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One \\nsays that District 12 has always been a bit backward \\nbut that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, \\nHaymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. \\nPeeta\\'s name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. \\nWe shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and \\nthe pro-gram ends. \\n\\nEffie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig \\nwas in. \"Your mentor has a lot to learn about \\npresentation. A lot about televised behavior.\" \\n\\nPeeta unexpectedly laughs. \"He was drunk,\" says \\nPeeta.\"He\\'s drunk every year.\" \\n\\n\"Every day,\" I add. I can\\'t help smirking a little. Effie \\n\\nTrinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has \\n\\n43 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsomewhat rough manners that could be corrected \\nwith a few tips from her. \\n\\n\"Yes,\" hisses Effie Trinket. \"How odd you two find it \\namusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the \\nworld in these Games. The one who advises you, lines \\nup your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of \\nany gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between \\nyour life and your death!\" \\n\\nJust then, Haymitch staggers into the compartment. \\n\"I miss supper?\" he says in a slurred voice. Then he \\nvomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the \\nmess. \\n\\n\"So laugh away!\" says Effie Trinket. She hops in her \\npointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the \\nroom. \\n\\n\\n\\n44 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nFor a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of \\nour mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff \\nfrom his stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits \\nalmost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance. \\nObviously Haymitch isn\\'t much, but Effie Trinket is \\nright about one thing, once we\\'re in the arena he\\'s all \\nwe\\'ve got. As if by some unspoken agreement, Peeta \\nand I each take one of Haymitch \\'s arms and help him \\nto his feet. \\n\\n\"I tripped?\" Haymitch asks. \"Smells bad.\" He wipes \\nhis hand on his nose, smearing his face with vomit. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s get you back to your room,\" says Peeta. \"Clean \\nyou up a bit.\" \\n\\nWe half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his \\ncompartment. Since we can\\'t exactly set him down on \\nthe embroidered bedspread, we haul him into the \\nbathtub and turn the shower on him. He hardly \\nnotices. \\n\\n\"It\\'s okay,\" Peeta says to me. \"Ill take it from here.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t help feeling a little grateful since the last thing \\nI want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit \\nout of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly \\nPeeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to \\nbe his favorite once the Games begin. But judging by \\nthe state he\\'s in, Haymitch will have no memory of \\nthis tomorrow. \\n\\n\"All right,\" I say. \"I can send one of the Capitol people \\nto help you.\" There\\'s any number on the train. \\n\\n\\n\\n45 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nCooking lor us. Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking \\ncare of us is their job. \\n\\n\"No. I don\\'t want them,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI nod and head to my own room. I understand how \\nPeeta feels. I can\\'t stand the sight of the Capitol \\npeople myself. But making them deal with Haymitch \\nmight be a small form of revenge. So I\\'m pondering \\nthe reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch \\nand all of a sudden I think, It\\'s because he\\'s being \\nkind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread. \\n\\nThe idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is \\nfar more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind \\npeople have a way of working their way inside me and \\nrooting there. And I can\\'t let Peeta do this. Not where \\nwe\\'re going. So I decide, from this moment on, to have \\nas little as possible to do with the baker\\'s son. \\n\\nWhen I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a \\nplatform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the \\ncookies Peeta\\'s father gave me out of the train, and \\nslam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of \\nthem. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground \\nand bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the \\ntrack. I only see the image for a moment, because the \\ntrain is off again, but it\\'s enough. Enough to remind \\nme of that other dandelion in the school yard years \\nago ... \\n\\nI had just turned away from Peeta Mellark\\'s bruised \\nface when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope \\nwasn\\'t lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I \\ngrabbed a bucket and Prim\\'s hand and headed to the \\nMeadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden- \\nheaded weeds. After we\\'d harvested those, we \\n\\n\\n\\n46 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nscrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile \\nuntil we\\'d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, \\nstems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves \\non dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread. \\n\\n\"What else?\" Prim asked me. \"What other food can we \\nfind?\" \\n\\n\"All kinds of things,\" I promised her. \"I just have to \\nremember them.\" \\n\\nMy mother had a book she\\'d brought with her from \\nthe apothecary shop. The pages were made of old \\nparchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. \\nNeat handwritten blocks told their names, where to \\ngather them, when they came in bloom, their medical \\nuses. But my father added other entries to the book. \\nPlants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, \\nwild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the \\nnight poring over those pages. \\n\\nThe next day, we were off school. For a while I hung \\naround the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked \\nup the courage to go under the fence. It was the first \\ntime I\\'d been there alone, without my father\\'s \\nweapons to protect me. But I retrieved the small bow \\nand arrows he\\'d made me from a hollow tree. I \\nprobably didn\\'t go more than twenty yards into the \\nwoods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the \\nbranches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. \\nAfter several hours, I had the good luck to kill a \\nrabbit. \\n\\nI\\'d shot a few rabbits before, with my father\\'s \\nguidance. But this I\\'d done on my own. \\n\\nWe hadn\\'t had meat in months. The sight of the \\nrabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She \\nroused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew \\n\\n\\n\\n47 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nwith the meat and some more greens Prim had \\ngathered. Then she acted confused and went back to \\nbed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a \\nbowl. \\n\\nThe woods became our savior, and each day I went a \\nbit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but \\nI was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, \\ncaught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a \\nsquirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various \\nplants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are \\ntricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and \\nyou\\'re dead. I checked and double-checked the plants \\nI harvested with my father\\'s pictures. I kept us alive. \\n\\nAny sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable \\nbreak of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at \\nfirst. Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the \\nwild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on. Bears \\nand cats lived deeper in, perhaps disliking the sooty \\nreek of our district. \\n\\nOn May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up \\nfor my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of \\ngrain and oil in Prim\\'s toy wagon. On the eighth of \\nevery month, I wasentitled to do the same. I couldn\\'t \\nstop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was \\nnot enough to live on, and there were other things to \\nbuy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn\\'t \\nabsolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It \\nwas frightening to enter that place without my father \\nat my side, but people had respected him, and they \\naccepted me. Game was game after all, no matter \\nwho\\'d shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the \\nwealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my \\nfather had told me and learning a few new tricks as \\nwell. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not \\nsquirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only \\ntrade for one if his wife wasn\\'t around. The Head \\n\\n\\n\\n48 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a \\npassion for strawberries. \\n\\nIn late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I \\nnoticed the plants growing around me. Tall with \\nleaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white \\npetals. I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging \\ninto the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the \\nroots. Small, bluish tubers that don\\'t look like much \\nbut boiled or baked are as good as any potato. \\n\"Katniss,\" I said aloud. It\\'s the plant I was named for. \\nAnd I heard my father\\'s voice joking, \"As long as you \\ncan find yourself, you\\'ll never starve.\" I spent hours \\nstirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, \\ngathering the tubers that floated to the top. That \\nnight, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we \\nwere all, for the first time in months, full. \\n\\nSlowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean \\nand cook and preserve some of the food I brought in \\nfor winter. People traded us or paid money for her \\nmedical remedies. One day, I heard her singing. \\n\\nPrim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept \\nwatching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I \\ndidn\\'t trust her. And some small gnarled place inside \\nme hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for \\nthe months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, \\nbut I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a \\nwall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing \\nwas ever the same between us again. \\n\\nNow I was going to die without that ever being set \\nright. I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the \\nJustice Building. I had told her I loved her, too, \\nthough. So maybe it would all balance out. \\n\\nFor a while I stand staring out the train window, \\n\\nwishing I could open it again, but unsure of what \\n\\n49 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nwould happen at such high speed. In the distance, I \\nsee the lights of another district. 7? 10? I don\\'t know. \\nI think about the people in their houses, settling in \\nfor bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn \\ntight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? \\nWere they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the \\nstrawberries? Or did it lay untouched on their plates? \\nDid they watch the recap of the day\\'s events on the \\nbattered old TV that sits on the table against the \\nwall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my mother \\nholding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already \\nstarted to slip away, leaving the weight of the world \\non my sister\\'s fragile shoulders? \\n\\nPrim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. \\nThe thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting \\nhimself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me. If \\nshe cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl \\nup there until she calms down and falls asleep. I\\'m so \\nglad I didn\\'t drown him. \\n\\nImagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. \\nThis day has been endless. Could Gale and I have \\nbeen eating blackberries only this morning? It seems \\nlike a lifetime ago. Like a long dream that deteriorated \\ninto a nightmare. Maybe, if I go to sleep, I will wake \\nup back in District 12, where I belong. \\n\\nProbably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, \\nbut I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into \\nbed in my underwear. The sheets are made of soft, \\nsilky fabric. A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate \\nwarmth. \\n\\nIf I\\'m going to cry, now is the time to do it. By \\nmorning, 111 be able to wash the damage done by the \\ntears from my face. But no tears come. I\\'m too tired or \\ntoo numb to cry. The only thing I feel is a desire to be \\n\\n\\n\\n50 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsomewhere else. So I let the train rock me into \\noblivion. \\n\\n\\n\\nGray light is leaking through the curtains when the \\nrapping rouses me. I hear Effie Trinket\\'s voice, calling \\nme to rise. \"Up, up, up! It\\'s going to be a big, big, big \\nday!\" I try and imagine, for a moment, what it must \\nbe like inside that woman\\'s head. What thoughts fill \\nher waking hours? What dreams come to her at \\nnight? I have no idea. \\n\\nI put the green outfit back on since it\\'s not really \\ndirty, just slightly crumpled from spending the night \\non the floor. My fingers trace the circle around the \\nlittle gold mockingj ay and I think of the woods, and of \\nmy father, and of my mother and Prim waking up, \\nhaving to get on with things. \\n\\nI slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for \\nthe reaping and it doesn\\'t look too bad, so I just leave \\nit up. It doesn\\'t matter. We can\\'t be far from the \\nCapitol now. And once we reach the city, my stylist \\nwill dictate my look for the opening ceremonies \\ntonight anyway. I just hope I get one who doesn\\'t \\nthink nudity is the last word in fashion. \\n\\nAs I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me \\nwith a cup of black coffee. She\\'s muttering obscenities \\nunder her breath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red \\nfrom the previous day\\'s indulgences, is chuckling. \\nPeeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed. \\n\\n\"Sit down! Sit down!\" says Haymitch, waving me over. \\nThe moment I slide into my chair I\\'m served an \\nenormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried \\npotatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. \\nThe basket of rolls they set before me would keep my \\nfamily going for a week. There\\'s an elegant glass of \\norange juice. At least, I think it\\'s orange juice. I\\'ve \\n\\n\\n\\n51 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nonly even tasted an orange once, at New Year\\'s when \\nmy father bought one as a special treat. A cup of \\ncoffee. My mother adores coffee, which we could \\nalmost never afford, but it only tastes bitter and thin \\nto me. A rich brown cup of something I\\'ve never seen. \\n\\n\"They call it hot chocolate,\" says Peeta. \"It\\'s good.\" \\n\\nI take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a \\nshudder runs through me. Even though the rest of \\nthe meal beckons, I ignore it until I\\'ve drained my \\ncup. Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold, \\nwhich is a substantial amount, being careful to not \\noverdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother \\ntold me that I always eat like 111 never see food again. \\nAnd I said, \"I won\\'t unless I bring it home.\" That shut \\nher up. \\n\\nWhen my stomach feels like it\\'s about to split open, I \\nlean back and take in my breakfast companions. \\nPeeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and \\ndipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn\\'t paid \\nmuch attention to his platter, but he\\'s knocking back \\na glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear \\nliquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it\\'s some \\nkind of spirit. I don\\'t know Haymitch, but I\\'ve seen \\nhim often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of \\nmoney on the counter of the woman who sells white \\nliquor. He\\'ll be incoherent by the time we reach the \\nCapitol. \\n\\nI realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 \\ntributes never stand a chance. It isn\\'t just that we\\'ve \\nbeen underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes \\nhave still been strong enough to make a go of it. But \\nwe rarely get sponsors and he\\'s a big part of the \\nreason why. The rich people who back tributes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\neither because they\\'re betting on them or simply for \\n\\n\\n\\n52 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe bragging rights of picking a winner \\xe2\\x80\\x94 expect \\nsomeone classier than Haymitch to deal with. \\n\\n\"So, you\\'re supposed to give us advice,\" I say to \\nHaymitch. \\n\\n\"Here\\'s some advice. Stay alive,\" says Haymitch, and \\nthen bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with \\nPeeta before I remember I\\'m having nothing more to \\ndo with him. I\\'m surprised to see the hardness in his \\neyes. He generally seems so mild. \\n\\n\"That\\'s very funny,\" says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes \\nout at the glass in Haymitch \\'s hand. It shatters on the \\nfloor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the \\nback of the train. \"Only not to us.\" \\n\\nHaymitch considers this a moment, then punches \\nPeeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When \\nhe turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife \\ninto the table between his hand and the bottle, barely \\nmissing his fingers. I brace myself to deflect his hit, \\nbut it doesn\\'t come. Instead he sits back and squints \\nat us. \\n\\n\"Well, what\\'s this?\" says Haymitch. \"Did I actually get \\na pair of fighters this year?\" \\n\\nPeeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of \\nice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to \\nthe red mark on his jaw. \\n\\n\"No,\" says Haymitch, stopping him. \"Let the bruise \\nshow. The audience will think you\\'ve mixed it up with \\nanother tribute before you\\'ve even made it to the \\narena.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s against the rules,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n53 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you \\nfought, you weren\\'t caught, even better,\" says \\nHaymitch. He turns to me. \"Can you hit anything \\nwith that knife besides a table?\" \\n\\nThe bow and arrow is my weapon. But I\\'ve spent a \\nfair amount of time throwing knives as well. \\nSometimes, if I\\'ve wounded an animal with an arrow, \\nit\\'s better to get a knife into it, too, before I approach \\nit. I realize that if I want Haymitch \\'s attention, this is \\nmy moment to make an impression. I yank the knife \\nout of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then \\nthrow it into the wall across the room. I was actually \\njust hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in \\nthe seam between two panels, making me look a lot \\nbetter than I am. \\n\\n\"Stand over here. Both of you,\" says Haymitch, \\nnodding to the middle of the room. We obey and he \\ncircles us, prodding us like animals at times, \\nchecking our muscles, examining our faces. \"Well, \\nyou\\'re not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once the \\nstylists get hold of you, youll be attractive enough.\" \\n\\nPeeta and I don\\'t question this. The Hunger Games \\naren\\'t a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes \\nalways seem to pull more sponsors. \\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll make a deal with you. You don\\'t \\ninterfere with my drinking, and 111 stay sober enough \\nto help you,\" says Haymitch. \"But you have to do \\nexactly what I say.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s not much of a deal but still a giant step forward \\nfrom ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all. \\n\\n\"Fine,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n54 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"So help us,\" I say. \"When we get to the arena, what\\'s \\nthe best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"One thing at a time. In a few minutes, well be \\npulling into the station. Youll be put in the hands of \\nyour stylists. You\\'re not going to like what they do to \\nyou. But no matter what it is, don\\'t resist,\" says \\nHaymitch. \\n\\n\"But \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" I begin. \\n\\n\"No buts. Don\\'t resist,\" says Haymitch. He takes the \\nbottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As \\nthe door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark. \\nThere are still a few lights inside, but outside it\\'s as if \\nnight has fallen again. I realize we must be in the \\ntunnel that runs up through the mountains into the \\nCapitol. The mountains form a natural barrier \\nbetween the Capitol and the eastern districts. It is \\nalmost impossible to enter from the east except \\nthrough the tunnels. This geographical advantage was \\na major factor in the districts losing the war that led \\nto my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to \\nscale the mountains, they were easy targets for the \\nCapitol\\'s air forces. \\n\\nPeeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train \\nspeeds along. The tunnel goes on and on and I think \\nof the tons of rock separating me from the sky, and \\nmy chest tightens. I hate being encased in stone this \\nway. It reminds me of the mines and my father, \\ntrapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried forever in \\nthe darkness. \\n\\nThe train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright \\nlight floods the compartment. We can\\'t help it. Both \\nPeeta and I run to the window to see what we\\'ve only \\nseen on television, the Capitol, the ruling city of \\nPanem. The cameras haven\\'t lied about its grandeur. \\n55 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIf anything, they have not quite captured the \\nmagnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow \\nof hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll \\ndown the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people \\nwith bizarre hair and painted faces who have never \\nmissed a meal. All the colors seem artificial, the pinks \\ntoo deep, the greens too bright, the yellows painful to \\nthe eyes, like the flat round disks of hard candy we \\ncan never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in \\nDistrict 12. \\n\\nThe people begin to point at us eagerly as they \\nrecognize a tribute train rolling into the city. I step \\naway from the window, sickened by their excitement, \\nknowing they can\\'t wait to watch us die. But Peeta \\nholds his ground, actually waving and smiling at the \\ngawking crowd. He only stops when the train pulls \\ninto the station, blocking us from their view. \\n\\nHe sees me staring at him and shrugs. \"Who knows?\" \\nhe says. \"One of them may be rich.\" \\n\\nI have misjudged him. I think of his actions since the \\nreaping began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His \\nfather showing up with the cookies and promising to \\nfeed Prim . . . did Peeta put him up to that? His tears \\nat the station. Volunteering to wash Haymitch but \\nthen challenging him this morning when apparently \\nthe nice-guy approach had failed. And now the \\nwaving at the window, already trying to win the \\ncrowd. \\n\\nAll of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense \\nhe has a plan forming. He hasn\\'t accepted his death. \\nHe is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also \\nmeans that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me \\nthe bread, is fighting hard to kill me. \\n\\n\\n\\n56 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nR-i-i-i-p! I grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua \\nhair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a \\nstrip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair \\nbeneath it. \"Sorry!\" she pipes in her silly Capitol \\naccent. \"You\\'re just so hairy!\" \\n\\nWhy do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why \\ndo their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the \\nends of their sentences go up as if they\\'re asking a \\nquestion? Odd vowels, clipped words, and always a \\nhiss on the letter s ... no wonder it\\'s impossible not to \\nmimic them. \\n\\nVenia makes what\\'s supposed to be a sympathetic \\nface. \"Good news, though. This is the last one. \\nReady?\"Iget a grip on the edges of the table I\\'m seated \\non and nod. The final swathe of my leg hair is \\nuprooted in a painful jerk. \\n\\nI\\'ve been in the Remake Center for more than three \\nhours and I still haven\\'t met my stylist. Apparently he \\nhas no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other \\nmembers of my prep team have addressed some \\nobvious problems. This has included scrubbing down \\nmy body with a gritty loam that has removed not only \\ndirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails \\ninto uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body \\nof hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of \\nmy eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff, leaving \\nme like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. I don\\'t like \\nit. My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely \\nvulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain \\nwith Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips. \\n\\n\\n\\n57 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re doing very well,\" says some guy named \\nFlavius. He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake \\nand applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his \\nmouth. \"If there\\'s one thing we can\\'t stand, it\\'s a \\nwhiner. Grease her down!\" \\n\\nVenia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire \\nbody has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me \\ndown with a lotion that first stings but then soothes \\nmy raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, \\nremoving the thin robe I\\'ve been allowed to wear off \\nand on. I stand there, completely naked, as the three \\ncircle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of \\nhair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they\\'re so \\nunlike people that I\\'m no more self-conscious than if \\na trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my \\nfeet. \\n\\nThe three step back and admire their work. \\n\"Excellent! You almost look like a human being now!\" \\nsays Flavius, and they all laugh. \\n\\nI force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I \\nam. \"Thank you,\" I say sweetly. \"We don\\'t have much \\ncause to look nice in District Twelve.\" \\n\\nThis wins them over completely. \"Of course, you \\ndon\\'t, you poor darling!\" says Octavia clasping her \\nhands together in distress for me. \\n\\n\"But don\\'t worry,\" says Venia. \"By the time Cinna is \\nthrough with you, you\\'re going to be absolutely \\ngorgeous!\" \\n\\n\"We promise! You know, now that we\\'ve gotten rid of \\nall the hair and filth, you\\'re not horrible at all!\" says \\nFlavius encouragingly. \"Let\\'s call Cinna!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n58 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThey dart out of the room. It\\'s hard to hate my prep \\nteam. They\\'re such total idiots. And yet, in an odd \\nway, I know they\\'re sincerely trying to help me. \\n\\nI look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the \\nimpulse to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my \\nstylist, will surely make me remove it at once. Instead \\nmy hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body \\nmy prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers \\nstroke the silky braids my mother so carefully \\narranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and shoes \\non the floor of my train car, never thinking about \\nretrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, \\nof home. Now I wish I had. \\n\\nThe door opens and a young man who must be Cinna \\nenters. I\\'m taken aback by how normal he looks. Most \\nof the stylists they interview on television are so dyed, \\nstenciled, and surgically altered they\\'re grotesque. \\nBut Cinna\\'s close-cropped hair appears to be its \\nnatural shade of brown. He\\'s in a simple black shirt \\nand pants. The only concession to self-alteration \\nseems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been \\napplied with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of \\ngold in his green eyes. And, despite my disgust with \\nthe Capitol and their hideous fashions, I can\\'t help \\nthinking how attractive it looks. \\n\\n\"Hello, Katniss. I\\'m Cinna, your stylist,\" he says in a \\nquiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitol\\'s \\naffectations. \\n\\n\"Hello,\" I venture cautiously. \\n\\n\"Just give me a moment, all right?\" he asks. He walks \\naround my naked body, not touching me, but taking \\nin every inch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to \\ncross my arms over my chest. \"Who did your hair?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n59 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"My mother,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect \\nbalance with your profile. She has very clever fingers,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\nI had expected someone flamboyant, someone older \\ntrying desperately to look young, someone who viewed \\nme as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter. \\nCinna has met none of these expectations. \\n\\n\"You\\'re new, aren\\'t you? I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen you \\nbefore,\" I say. Most of the stylists are familiar, \\nconstants in the ever-changing pool of tributes. Some \\nhave been around my whole life. \\n\\n\"Yes, this is my first year in the Games,\" says Cinna. \\n\\n\"So they gave you District Twelve,\" I say. Newcomers \\ngenerally end up with us, the least desirable district. \\n\\n\"I asked for District Twelve,\" he says without further \\nexplanation. \"Why don\\'t you put on your robe and \\nwell have a chat.\" \\n\\nPulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a \\nsitting room. Two red couches face off over a low \\ntable. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely \\nglass, providing a window to the city. I can see by the \\nlight that it must be around noon, although the \\nsunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to \\nsit on one of the couches and takes his place across \\nfrom me. He presses a button on the side of the table. \\nThe top splits and from below rises a second tabletop \\nthat holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges \\ncooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly \\nwhite grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped \\nlike flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of \\nhoney. \\n\\n\\n\\n60 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI try to imagine assembling this meal myself back \\nhome. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make \\ndo with a wild turkey. I\\'d need to shoot a second \\nturkey to trade for an orange. Goat\\'s milk would have \\nto substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the \\ngarden. I\\'d have to get wild onions from the woods. I \\ndon\\'t recognize the grain, our own tessera ration \\ncooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy \\nrolls would mean another trade with the baker, \\nperhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, \\nI can\\'t even guess what\\'s in it. Days of hunting and \\ngathering for this one meal and even then it would be \\na poor substitution for the Capitol version. \\n\\nWhat must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world \\nwhere food appears at the press of a button? How \\nwould I spend the hours I now commit to combing the \\nwoods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? \\nWhat do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, \\nbesides decorating their bodies and waiting around \\nfor a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for \\ntheir entertainment? \\n\\nI look up and find Cinna\\'s eyes trained on mine. \"How \\ndespicable we must seem to you,\" he says. \\n\\nHas he seen this in my face or somehow read my \\nthoughts? He\\'s right, though. The whole rotten lot of \\nthem is despicable. \\n\\n\"No matter,\" says Cinna. \"So, Katniss, about your \\ncostume for the opening ceremonies. My partner, \\nPortia, is the stylist for your fellow tribute, Peeta. And \\nour current thought is to dress you in complementary \\ncostumes,\" says Cinna. \"As you know, it\\'s customary \\nto reflect the flavor of the district.\" \\n\\nFor the opening ceremonies, you\\'re supposed to wear \\n\\nsomething that suggests your district\\'s principal \\n\\n61 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nindustry. District 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. \\nDistrict 3, factories. This means that coming from \\nDistrict 12, Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal \\nminer\\'s getup. Since the baggy miner\\'s jumpsuits are \\nnot particularly becoming, our tributes usually end \\nup in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One \\nyear, our tributes were stark naked and covered in \\nblack powder to represent coal dust. It\\'s always \\ndreadful and does nothing to win favor with the \\ncrowd. I prepare myself for the worst. \\n\\n\"So, I\\'ll be in a coal miner outfit?\" I ask, hoping it \\nwon\\'t be indecent. \\n\\n\"Not exactly. You see, Portia and I think that coal \\nminer thing\\'s very overdone. No one will remember \\nyou in that. And we both see it as our job to make the \\nDistrict Twelve tributes unforgettable,\" says Cinna. \\n\\nI\\'ll be naked for sure, I think. \\n\\n\"So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, we\\'re \\ngoing to focus on the coal,\" says Cinna. Naked and \\ncovered in black dust, I think. \"And what do we do \\nwith coal? We burn it,\" says Cinna. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss?\" He sees \\nmy expression and grins. \\n\\nA few hours later, I am dressed in what will either be \\nthe most sensational or the deadliest costume in the \\nopening ceremonies. I\\'m in a simple black unitard \\nthat covers me from ankle to neck. Shiny leather \\nboots lace up to my knees. But it\\'s the fluttering cape \\nmade of streams of orange, yellow, and red and the \\nmatching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna \\nplans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls \\ninto the streets. \\n\\n\\n\\n62 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic \\nfire Portia and I came up with. Youll be perfectly \\nsafe,\" he says. But I\\'m not convinced I won\\'t be \\nperfectly barbecued by the time we reach the city\\'s \\ncenter. \\n\\nMy face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of \\nhighlighting here and there. My hair has been \\nbrushed out and then braided down my back in my \\nusual style. \"I want the audience to recognize you \\nwhen you\\'re in the arena,\" says Cinna \\ndreamily. \"Katniss, the girl who was on fire.\" \\n\\nIt crosses my mind that Cinna\\'s calm and normal \\ndemeanor masks a complete madman. \\n\\nDespite this morning\\'s revelation about Peeta\\'s \\ncharacter, I\\'m actually relieved when he shows up, \\ndressed in an identical costume. He should know \\nabout fire, being a baker\\'s son and all. His stylist, \\nPortia, and her team accompany him in, and everyone \\nis absolutely giddy with excitement over what a \\nsplash well make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit \\nweary as he accepts congratulations. \\n\\nWe\\'re whisked down to the bottom level of the \\nRemake Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. \\nThe opening ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of \\ntributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by \\nteams of four horses. Ours are coal black. The \\nanimals are so well trained, no one even needs to \\nguide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the \\nchariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the \\ndrape of our capes, before moving off to consult with \\neach other. \\n\\n\"What do you think?\" I whisper to Peeta. \"About the \\nfire?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n63 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll rip off your cape if you 11 rip off mine,\" he says \\nthrough gritted teeth. \\n\\n\"Deal,\" I say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon \\nenough, well avoid the worst burns. It\\'s bad though. \\nThey\\'ll throw us into the arena no matter what \\ncondition we\\'re in. \"I know we promised Haymitch \\nwe\\'d do exactly what they said, but I don\\'t think he \\nconsidered this angle.\" \\n\\n\"Where is Haymitch, anyway? Isn\\'t he supposed to \\nprotect us from this sort of thing?\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"With all that alcohol in him, it\\'s probably not \\nadvisable to have him around an open flame,\" I say. \\n\\nAnd suddenly we\\'re both laughing. I guess we\\'re both \\nso nervous about the Games and more pressingly, \\npetrified of being turned into human torches, we\\'re \\nnot acting sensibly. \\n\\nThe opening music begins. It\\'s easy to hear, blasted \\naround the Capitol. Massive doors slide open \\nrevealing the crowd-lined streets. The ride lasts about \\ntwenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle, where \\nthey will welcome us, play the anthem, and escort us \\ninto the Training Center, which will be our \\nhome/ prison until the Games begin. \\n\\nThe tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot \\npulled by snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, \\nspray-painted silver, in tasteful tunics glittering with \\njewels. District 1 makes luxury items for the Capitol. \\nYou can hear the roarofthe crowd. They are always \\nfavorites. \\n\\nDistrict 2 gets into position to follow them. In no time \\nat all, we are approaching the door and I can see that \\nbetween the overcast sky and evening hour the light \\n\\n\\n\\n64 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nis turning gray. The tributes from District 1 1 are just \\nrolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. \\n\"Here we go then,\" he says, and before we can react \\nhe sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for the heat, \\nbut there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna \\nclimbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He \\nlets out a sign of relief. \"It works.\" Then he gently \\ntucks a hand under my chin. \"Remember, heads high. \\nSmiles. They\\'re going to love you!\" \\n\\nCinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He \\nshouts something up at us, but the music drowns \\nhim out. He shouts again and gestures. \\n\\n\"What\\'s he saying?\" I ask Peeta. For the first time, I \\nlook at him and realize that ablaze with the fake \\nflames, he is dazzling. And I must be, too. \\n\\n\"I think he said for us to hold hands,\" says Peeta. He \\ngrabs my right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna \\nfor confirmation. He nods and gives a thumbs-up, \\nand that\\'s the last thing I see before we enter the city. \\n\\nThe crowd\\'s initial alarm at our appearance quickly \\nchanges to cheers and shouts of \"District Twelve!\" \\nEvery head is turned our way, pulling the focus from \\nthe three chariots ahead of us. At first, I\\'m frozen, but \\nthen I catch sight of us on a large television screen \\nand am floored by how breathtaking we look. In the \\ndeepening twilight, the firelight illuminates our faces. \\nWe seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing \\ncapes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, \\nwe both look more attractive but utterly recognizable. \\n\\nRemember, heads high. Smiles. They\\'re going to love \\nyou! I hear Cinna\\'s voice in my head. I lift my chin a \\nbit higher, put on my most winning smile, and wave \\nwith my free hand. I\\'m glad now I have Peeta to clutch \\nfor balance, he is so steady, solid as a rock. As I gain \\n65 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nconfidence, I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd. \\nThe people of the Capitol are going nuts, showering \\nus with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, \\nwhich they have bothered to find on the program. \\n\\nThe pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work \\ntheir way into my blood, and I can\\'t suppress my \\nexcitement. Cinna has given me a great advantage. No \\none will forget me. Not my look, not my name. \\nKatniss. The girl who was on fire. \\n\\nFor the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in \\nme. Surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take \\nme on! And with a little extra help, some food, the \\nright weapon, why should I count myself out of the \\nGames? \\n\\nSomeone throws me a red rose. I catch it, give it a \\ndelicate sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general \\ndirection of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to \\ncatch my kiss, as if it were a real and tangible thing. \\n\\n\"Katniss! Katniss!\" I can hear my name being called \\nfrom all sides. Everyone wants my kisses. \\n\\nIt\\'s not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I \\nmust have completely stopped the circulation in \\nPeeta\\'s hand. That\\'s how tightly I\\'ve been holding it. I \\nlook down at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp, \\nbut he regains his grip on me. \"No, don\\'t let go of me,\" \\nhe says. The firelight flickers off his blue eyes. \\n\"Please. I might fall out of this thing.\" \\n\\n\"Okay,\" I say. So I keep holding on, but I can\\'t help \\nfeeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us \\ntogether. It\\'s not really fair to present us as a team \\nand then lock us into the arena to kill each other. \\n\\n\\n\\n66 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On \\nthe buildings that surround the Circle, every window \\nis packed with the most prestigious citizens of the \\nCapitol. Our horses pull our chariot right up to \\nPresident Snow\\'s mansion, and we come to a halt. \\nThe music ends with a flourish. \\n\\nThe president, a small, thin man with paper-white \\nhair, gives the official welcome from a balcony above \\nus. It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the \\ntributes during the speech. But I can see on the \\nscreen that we are getting way more than our share of \\nairtime. The darker it becomes, the more difficult it is \\nto take your eyes off our flickering. When the national \\nanthem plays, they do make an effort to do a quick \\ncut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera \\nholds on the District 12 chariot as it parades around \\nthe circle one final time and disappears into the \\nTraining Center. \\n\\nThe doors have only just shut behind us when we\\'re \\nengulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly \\nunintelligible as they babble out praise. As I glance \\naround, I notice a lot of the other tributes are \\nshooting us dirty looks, which confirms what I\\'ve \\nsuspected, we\\'ve literally outshone them all. Then \\nCinna and Portia are there, helping us down from the \\nchariot, carefully removing our flaming capes and \\nheaddresses. Portia extinguishes them with some \\nkind of spray from a canister. \\n\\nI realize I\\'m still glued to Peeta and force my stiff \\nfingers to open. We both massage our hands. \\n\\n\"Thanks for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little \\nshaky there,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"It didn\\'t show,\" I tell him. \"I\\'m sure no one noticed.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n67 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure they didn\\'t notice anything but you. You \\nshould wear flames more often,\" he says. \"They suit \\nyou.\" And then he gives me a smile that seems so \\ngenuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness \\nthat unexpected warmth rushes through me. \\n\\nA warning bell goes off in my head. Don\\'t be so \\nstupid. Peeta is planning how to kill you, I remind \\nmyself. He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The \\nmore likable he is, the more deadly he is. \\n\\nBut because two can play at this game, I stand on \\ntiptoe and kiss his cheek. Right on his bruise. \\n\\n\\n\\n68 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Training Center has a tower designed exclusively \\nfor the tributes and their teams. This will be our \\nhome until the actual Games begin. Each district has \\nan entire floor. You simply step onto an elevator and \\npress the number of your district. Easy enough to \\nremember. \\n\\nI\\'ve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the \\nJustice Building back in District 12. Once to receive \\nthe medal for my father\\'s death and then yesterday to \\nsay my final goodbyes to my friends and family. But \\nthat\\'s a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail \\nand smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are \\nmade of crystal so that you can watch the people on \\nthe ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into \\nthe air. It\\'s exhilarating and I\\'m tempted to ask Effie \\nTrinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that \\nseems childish. \\n\\nApparently, Effie Trinket\\'s duties did not conclude at \\nthe station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us \\nright into the arena. In a way, that\\'s a plus because at \\nleast she can be counted on to corral us around to \\nplaces on time whereas we haven\\'t seen Haymitch \\nsince he agreed to help us on the train. Probably \\npassed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other \\nhand, seems to be flying high. We\\'re the first team \\nshe\\'s ever chaperoned that made a splash at the \\nopening ceremonies. She\\'s complimentary about not \\njust our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. \\nAnd, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who\\'s \\nanyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all \\nday, trying to win us sponsors. \\n\\n\\n\\n69 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been very mysterious, though,\" she says, her \\neyes squint half shut. \"Because, of course, Haymitch \\nhasn\\'t bothered to tell me your strategies. But I\\'ve \\ndone my best with what I had to work with. How \\nKatniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How you\\'ve \\nboth successfully struggled to overcome the \\nbarbarism of your district.\" \\n\\nBarbarism? That\\'s ironic coming from a woman \\nhelping to prepare us for slaughter. And what\\'s she \\nbasing our success on? Our table manners? \\n\\n\"Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being \\nfrom the coal district. But I said, and this was very \\nclever of me, I said, Well, if you put enough pressure \\non coal it turns to pearls!\\'\" Effie beams at us so \\nbrilliantly that we have no choice but to respond \\nenthusiastically to her cleverness even though it\\'s \\nwrong. \\n\\nCoal doesn\\'t turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. \\nPossibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but that\\'s \\nuntrue, too. I\\'ve heard they have some sort of \\nmachine in District 1 that can turn graphite into \\ndiamonds. But we don\\'t mine graphite in District 12. \\nThat was part of District 13\\'s job until they were \\ndestroyed. \\n\\nI wonder if the people she\\'s been plugging us to all \\nday either know or care. \\n\\n\"Unfortunately, I can\\'t seal the sponsor deals for you. \\nOnly Haymitch can do that,\" says Effie grimly. \"But \\ndon\\'t worry, 111 get him to the table at gunpoint if \\nnecessary.\" \\n\\nAlthough lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket \\nhas a certain determination I have to admire. \\n\\n\\n\\n70 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nMy quarters are larger than our entire house back \\nhome. They are plush, like the train car, but also \\nhave so many automatic gadgets that I\\'m sure I won\\'t \\nhave time to press all the buttons. The shower alone \\nhas a panel with more than a hundred options you \\ncan choose regulating water temperature, pressure, \\nsoaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging \\nsponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come \\non that blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with \\nthe knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a \\nbox that sends a current through my scalp, \\nuntangling, parting, and drying my hair almost \\ninstantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a \\nglossy curtain. \\n\\nI program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The \\nwindows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my \\ncommand. You need only whisper a type of food from \\na gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears, \\nhot and steamy, before you in less than a minute. I \\nwalk around the room eating goose liver and puffy \\nbread until there\\'s a knock on the door. Effie\\'s calling \\nme to dinner. \\n\\nGood. I\\'m starving. \\n\\nPeeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a \\nbalcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the \\ndining room. I\\'m glad to see the stylists, particularly \\nafter I hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal \\npresided over by just \\n\\nEffie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, \\ndinner isn\\'t really about food, it\\'s about planning out \\nour strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already \\nproven how valuable they are. \\n\\nA silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us \\nall stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it \\n71 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndown, but I\\'ve never had wine, except the homemade \\nstuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will I get \\na chance to try it again? I take a sip of the tart, dry \\nliquid and secretly think it could be improved by a \\nfew spoonfuls of honey. \\n\\nHaymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It \\nlooks as if he\\'s had his own stylist because he\\'s clean \\nand groomed and about as sober as I\\'ve ever seen \\nhim. He doesn\\'t refuse the offer of wine, but when he \\nstarts in on his soup, I realize it\\'s the first time I\\'ve \\never seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull himself \\ntogether long enough to help us. \\n\\nCinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on \\nHaymitch and Effie. At least they\\'re addressing each \\nother decently. And they both have nothing but praise \\nfor our stylists \\'opening act. While they make small \\ntalk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, \\nbitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast \\nbeef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, \\ncheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet \\nblue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in \\nwhite tunics like the one who gave us wine, move \\nwordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters \\nand glasses full. \\n\\nAbout halfway through my glass of wine, my head \\nstarts feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I \\ndon\\'t like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How \\nHaymitch can stand walking around like this full-time \\nis a mystery. \\n\\nI try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our \\ninterview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous- \\nlooking cake on the table and deftly lights it. It blazes \\nup and then the flames flicker around the edges \\nawhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of \\ndoubt. \"What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?\" I say, \\n72 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nlooking up at the girl. \"That\\'s the last thing I wa \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\noh! I know you!\" \\n\\nI can\\'t place a name or time to the girl\\'s face. But I\\'m \\ncertain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, \\nthe porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the \\nwords, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and \\nguilt at the sight of her, and while I can\\'t pull it up, I \\nknow some bad memory is associated with her. The \\nexpression of terror that crosses her face only adds to \\nmy confusion and unease. She shakes her head in \\ndenial quickly and hurries away from the table. \\n\\nWhen I look back, the four adults are watching me \\nlike hawks. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly \\nknow an Avox?\" snaps Effie. \"The very thought.\" \\n\\n\"What\\'s an Avox?\" I ask stupidly. \\n\\n\"Someone who committed a crime. They cut her \\ntongue so she can\\'t speak,\" says Haymitch. \"She\\'s \\nprobably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you\\'d know \\nher.\" \\n\\n\"And even if you did, you\\'re not to speak to one of \\nthem unless it\\'s to give an order,\" says Effie. \"Of \\ncourse, you don\\'t really know her.\" \\n\\nBut I do know her. And now that Haymitch has \\nmentioned the word traitor I remember from where. \\nThe disapproval is so high I could never admit it. \"No, \\nI guess not, I just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" I stammer, and the wine is not \\nhelping. \\n\\nPeeta snaps his fingers. \"Delly Cartwright. That\\'s who \\nit is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then \\nI realized she\\'s a dead ringer for Delly.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n73 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nDelly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with \\nyellowish hair who looks about as much like our \\nserver as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be \\nthe friendliest person on the planet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she smiles \\nconstantly at everybody in school, even me. I have \\nnever seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump \\non Peeta\\'s suggestion gratefully. \"Of course, that\\'s \\nwho I was thinking of. It must be the hair,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Something about the eyes, too,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nThe energy at the table relaxes. \"Oh, well. If that\\'s all \\nit is,\" says Cinna. \"And yes, the cake has spirits, but \\nall the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in \\nhonor of your fiery debut.\" \\n\\nWe eat the cake and move into a sitting room to \\nwatch the replay of the opening ceremonies that\\'s \\nbeing broadcast. A few of the other couples make a \\nnice impression, but none of them can hold a candle \\nto us. Even our own party lets out an \"Ahh!\" as they \\nshow us coming out of the Remake Center. \\n\\n\"Whose idea was the hand holding?\" asks Haymitch. \\n\\n\"Cinna\\'s,\" says Portia. \\n\\n\"Just the perfect touch of rebellion,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"Very nice.\" \\n\\nRebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. \\nBut when I remember the other couples, standing \\nstiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each \\nother, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the \\nGames had already begun, I know what Haymitch \\nmeans. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as \\nfriends has distinguished us as much as the fiery \\ncostumes. \\n\\n\\n\\n74 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet \\nme for breakfast and I\\'ll tell you exactly how I want \\nyou to play it, \"says Haymitch to Peeta and I. \"Now go \\nget some sleep while the grown-ups talk.\" \\n\\nPeeta and I walk together down the corridor to our \\nrooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the \\nframe, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting \\nI pay attention to him. \"So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine \\nfinding her lookalike here.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s asking for an explanation, and I\\'m tempted to \\ngive him one. We both know he covered for me. So \\nhere I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth \\nabout the girl, somehow that might even things up. \\nHow can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, \\nit couldn\\'t do me much harm. It was just something I \\nwitnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly \\nCartwright. \\n\\nI realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. \\nSomeone who might be able to help me figure out her \\nstory. \\n\\nGale would be my first choice, but it\\'s unlikely I\\'ll ever \\nsee Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give \\nhim any possible advantage over me, but I don\\'t see \\nhow. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make \\nhim believe I see him as a friend. \\n\\nBesides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue \\nfrightens me. She has reminded me why I\\'m here. Not \\nto model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to \\ndie a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer. \\n\\nTo tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the \\nwine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the \\ndecision lies there. \\n\\n\\n\\n75 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta picks up on my hesitation. \"Have you been on \\nthe roof yet?\" I shake my head. \"Cinna showed me. \\nYou can practically see the whole city. The wind\\'s a \\nbit loud, though.\" \\n\\nI translate this into \"No one will overhear us \\ntalking\"in my head. You do have the sense that we \\nmight be under surveillance here. \"Can we just go \\nup?\" \\n\\n\"Sure, come on,\" says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of \\nstairs that lead to the roof. There\\'s a small dome- \\nshaped room with a door to the outside. As we step \\ninto the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at \\nthe view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of \\nfireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, \\nusually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the \\nevenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you \\ncan count on it is when they\\'re airing the Games or \\nsome important government message on television \\nthat it\\'s mandatory to watch. But here there would be \\nno shortage. Ever. \\n\\nPeeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I \\nlook straight down the side of the building to the \\nstreet, which is buzzing with people. You can hear \\ntheir cars, an occasional shout, and a strange \\nmetallic tinkling. In District 12, we\\'d all be thinking \\nabout bed right now. \\n\\n\"I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren\\'t they \\nworried that some of the tributes might decide to \\njump right over the side?\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"What\\'d he say?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"You can\\'t,\" says Peeta. He holds out his hand into \\nseemingly empty space. There\\'s a sharp zap and he \\n\\n\\n\\n76 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\njerks it back. \"Some kind of electric field throws you \\nback on the roof.\" \\n\\n\"Always worried about our safety,\" I say. Even though \\nCinna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we\\'re \\nsupposed to be up here now, so late and alone. I\\'ve \\nnever seen tributes on the Training Center roof \\nbefore. But that doesn\\'t mean we\\'re not being taped. \\n\"Do you think they\\'re watching us now?\" \\n\\n\"Maybe,\" he admits. \"Come see the garden.\" \\n\\nOn the other side of the dome, they\\'ve built a garden \\nwith flower beds and potted trees. From the branches \\nhang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the \\ntinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy \\nnight, it\\'s enough to drown out two people who are \\ntrying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly. \\n\\nI pretend to examine a blossom. \"We were hunting in \\nthe woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,\" I \\nwhisper. \\n\\n\"You and your father?\" he whispers back. \\n\\n\"No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped \\nsinging at once. Except one. As if it were giving a \\nwarning call. And then we saw her. I\\'m sure it was \\nthe same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were \\ntattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from \\nno sleep. They were running as if their lives depended \\non it,\" I say. \\n\\nFor a moment I\\'m silent, as I remember how the sight \\nof this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, \\nfleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we \\nwondered if we could have helped them escape. \\nPerhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we\\'d \\nmoved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, \\n77 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nyes, but we\\'re both hunters. We know how animals \\nlook at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon \\nas we saw them. But we only watched. \\n\\n\"The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,\" I continue \\nto Peeta. \"I mean, one moment the sky was empty and \\nthe next it was there. It didn\\'t make a sound, but they \\nsaw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her \\nup, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort \\nof spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable \\nand they hauled him up as well. But I\\'m certain he \\nwas dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy\\'s \\nname, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. \\nVanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing \\nagain, as if nothing had happened.\" \\n\\n\"Did they see you?\" Peeta asked. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. We were under a shelf of rock,\" I reply. \\n\\nBut I do know. There was a moment, after the \\nbirdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had \\nseen us. She\\'d locked eyes with me and called out for \\nhelp. But neither Gale or I had responded. \\n\\n\"You\\'re shivering,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nThe wind and the story have blown all the warmth \\nfrom my body. The girl\\'s scream. Had it been her last? \\n\\nPeeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my \\nshoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let \\nhim, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket \\nand his kindness. A friend would do that, right? \\n\\n\"They were from here?\" he asks, and he secures a \\nbutton at my neck. \\n\\n\\n\\n78 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI nod. They\\'d had that Capitol look about them. The \\nboy and the girl. \\n\\n\"Where do you suppose they were going?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that,\" I say. District 12 is pretty much \\nthe end of the line. Beyond us, there\\'s only \\nwilderness. If you don\\'t count the ruins of District 13 \\nthat still smolder from the toxic bombs. They show it \\non television occasionally, just to remind us. \"Or why \\nthey would leave here.\" Haymitch had called the \\nAvoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the \\nCapitol. But they had everything here. No cause to \\nrebel. \\n\\n\"I\\'d leave here,\" Peeta blurts out. Then he looks \\naround nervously. It was loud enough to hear above \\nthe chimes. He laughs. \"I\\'d go home now if they let me. \\nBut you have to admit, the food\\'s prime.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s covered again. If that\\'s all you\\'d heard it would \\njust sound like the words of a scared tribute, not \\nsomeone contemplating the unquestionable goodness \\nof the Capitol. \\n\\n\"It\\'s getting chilly. We better go in,\" he says. Inside \\nthe dome, it\\'s warm and bright. His tone is \\nconversational. \"Your friend Gale. He\\'s the one who \\ntook your sister away at the reaping?\" \\n\\n\"Yes. Do you know him?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I \\nthought he was your cousin or something. You favor \\neach other,\" he says. \\n\\n\"No, we\\'re not related,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n79 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta nods, unreadable. \"Did he come to say good-bye \\nto you?\" \\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say, observing him carefully. \"So did your \\nfather. He brought me cookies.\" \\n\\nPeeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after \\nwatching him lie so smoothly, I don\\'t give this much \\nweight. \"Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I \\nthink he wishes he had a daughter instead of a \\nhouseful of boys.\" \\n\\nThe idea that I might ever have been discussed, \\naround the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in \\npassing in Peeta\\'s house gives me a start. It must \\nhave been when the mother was out of the room. \\n\\n\"He knew your mother when they were kids,\" says \\nPeeta. \\n\\nAnother surprise. But probably true. \"Oh, yes. She \\ngrew up in town,\" I say. It seems impolite to say she \\nnever mentioned the baker except to compliment his \\nbread. \\n\\nWe\\'re at my door. I give back his jacket. \"See you in \\nthe morning then.\" \\n\\n\"See you,\" he says, and walks off down the hall. \\n\\nWhen I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting \\nmy unitard and boots from where I left them on the \\nfloor before my shower. I want to apologize for \\npossibly getting her in trouble earlier. But I remember \\nI\\'m not supposed to speak to her unless I\\'m giving her \\nan order. \\n\\n\"Oh, sorry,\" I say. \"I was supposed to get those back \\nto Cinna. I\\'m sorry. Can you take them to him?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n80 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nShe avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out \\nthe door. \\n\\nI\\'d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I \\nknow that my apology runs much deeper. That I\\'m \\nashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I \\nlet the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without \\nlifting a finger. \\n\\nJust like I was watching the Games. \\n\\nI kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my \\nclothes. The shivering hasn\\'t stopped. Perhaps the girl \\ndoesn\\'t even remember me. But I know she does. You \\ndon\\'t forget the face of the person who was your last \\nhope. I pull the covers up over my head as if this will \\nprotect me from the redheaded girl who can\\'t speak. \\nBut I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through \\nwalls and doors and bedding. \\n\\nI wonder if shell enjoy watching me die. \\n\\n\\n\\n81 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\nMy slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The \\nface of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory \\nimages from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother \\nwithdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated \\nand terrified. I bolt up screaming for my father to run \\nas the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of \\nlight. \\n\\nDawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol \\nhas a misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must \\nhave bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My \\ntongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood. \\n\\nSlowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I \\narbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and \\nend up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of \\nicy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then I\\'m \\ndeluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with \\na heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is \\nflowing. \\n\\nWhen I\\'m dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an \\noutfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. \\nTight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and \\nleather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down \\nmy back. This is the first time since the morning of \\nthe reaping that I resemble myself. No fancy hair and \\nclothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like I \\ncould be headed for the woods. It calms me. \\n\\nHaymitch didn\\'t give us an exact time to meet for \\nbreak-last and no one has contacted me this \\nmorning, but I\\'m hungry so I head down to the dining \\nroom, hoping there will be food. I\\'m not disappointed. \\n\\n\\n\\n82 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the table is empty, a long board off to the side \\nhas been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young \\nman, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. \\nWhen I ask if I can serve myself, he nods assent. I \\nload a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered \\nin thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon. \\nAs I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the \\nCapitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered \\nin beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at \\nthe table, breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot \\nchocolate, the way Peeta did on the train. \\n\\nMy mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must \\nbe up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. \\nPrim milking her goat before school. Just two \\nmornings ago, I was home. Can that be right? Yes, \\njust two. And now how empty the house feels, even \\nfrom a distance. What did they say last night about \\nmy fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, \\nor simply add to their terror when they saw the reality \\nof twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only \\none could live? \\n\\nHaymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, \\nfill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is \\nwearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say \\nsomething to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow \\nup in out faces once the Games begin. Surely, they \\nmust know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling \\nme to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it \\nwas anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore \\nhim. But after last night\\'s triumph, I don\\'t have a lot \\nof room to criticize his choices. \\n\\nI\\'m nervous about the training. There will be three \\ndays in which all the tributes practice together. On \\nthe last afternoon, we\\'ll each get a chance to perform \\nin private before the Gamemakers. The thought of \\nmeeting the other tributes face-to-face makes me \\n83 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nqueasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from the \\nbasket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is \\ngone. \\n\\nWhen Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, \\nhe pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask \\nfrom his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans \\nhis elbows on the table. \"So, let\\'s get down to \\nbusiness. Training. First off, if you like, 111 coach you \\nseparately. Decide now.\" \\n\\n\"Why would you coach us separately?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the \\nother to know about,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nI exchange a look with Peeta. \"I don\\'t have any secret \\nskills,\" he says. \"And I already know what yours is, \\nright? I mean, I\\'ve eaten enough of your squirrels.\" \\n\\nI never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I \\nshot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly \\ngoing off and frying them up for himself. Not out of \\ngreed. But because town families usually eat \\nexpensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse. \\n\\n\"You can coach us together,\" I tell Haymitch. Peeta \\nnods. \\n\\n\"All right, so give me some idea of what you can \\ndo, \"says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"I can\\'t do anything,\" says Peeta. \"Unless you count \\nbaking bread.\" \\n\\n\"Sorry, I don\\'t. Katniss. I already know you\\'re handy \\nwith a knife,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\\n\\n84 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not really. But I can hunt,\" I say. \"With a bow and \\narrow.\" \\n\\n\"And you\\'re good?\" asks Haymitch. \\n\\nI have to think about it. I\\'ve been putting food on the \\ntable for four years. That\\'s no small task. I\\'m not as \\ngood as my father was, but he\\'d had more practice. \\nI\\'ve better aim than Gale, but I\\'ve had more practice. \\nHe\\'s a genius with traps and snares. \"I\\'m all right,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"She\\'s excellent,\" says Peeta. \"My father buys her \\nsquirrels. He always comments on how the arrows \\nnever pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. \\nIt\\'s the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. \\nShe can even bring down deer.\" \\n\\nThis assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me \\ntotally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. \\nSecond, that he\\'s talking me up. \"What are you \\ndoing?\" I ask him suspiciously. \\n\\n\"What are you doing? If he\\'s going to help you, he has \\nto know what you\\'re capable of. Don\\'t underrate \\nyourself,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI don\\'t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. \\n\"What about you? I\\'ve seen you in the market. You \\ncan lift hundred-pound bags of flour,\" I snap at him. \\n\"Tell him that. That\\'s not nothing.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, and I\\'m sure the arena will be full of bags of \\nflour for me to chuck at people. It\\'s not like being able \\nto use a weapon. You know it isn\\'t,\" he shoots back. \\n\\n\"He can wrestle,\" I tell Haymitch. \"He came in second \\nin our school competition last year, only after his \\nbrother.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n85 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"What use is that? How many times have you seen \\nsomeone wrestle someone to death?\" says Peeta in \\ndisgust. \\n\\n\"There\\'s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is \\nto come up with a knife, and youll at least stand a \\nchance. If I get jumped, I\\'m dead!\" I can hear my voice \\nrising in anger. \\n\\n\"But you won\\'t! Youll be living up in some tree eating \\nraw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You \\nknow what my mother said to me when she came to \\nsay good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe \\nDistrict Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I \\nrealized, she didn\\'t mean me, she meant you!\" bursts \\nout Peeta. \\n\\n\"Oh, she meant you,\" I say with a wave of dismissal. \\n\\n\"She said, \\'She\\'s a survivor, that one.\\'Sheis,\" says \\nPeeta. \\n\\nThat pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that \\nabout me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the \\npain in Peeta\\'s eyes and know he isn\\'t lying. \\n\\nSuddenly I\\'m behind the bakery and I can feel the \\nchill of the rain running down my back, the \\nhollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when \\nI speak. \"But only because someone helped me.\" \\n\\nPeeta\\'s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and \\nI know he remembers that day, too. But he just \\nshrugs. \"People will help you in the arena. They 11 be \\ntripping over each other to sponsor you.\" \\n\\n\"No more than you,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n86 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. \"She has no idea. \\nThe effect she can have.\" He runs his fingernail along \\nthe wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me. \\n\\nWhat on earth does he mean? People help me? When \\nwe were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one \\nexcept Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, \\nthings changed. I\\'m a tough trader. Or am I? What \\neffect do I have? That I\\'m weak and needy? Is he \\nsuggesting that I got good deals because people pitied \\nme? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the \\nmerchants were a little generous in their trades, but I \\nalways attributed that to their long-standing \\nrelationship with my father. Besides, my game is first- \\nclass. No one pitied me! \\n\\nI glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. \\n\\nAfter about a minute of this, Haymitch says, \"Well, \\nthen. Well, well, well. Katniss, there\\'s no guarantee \\nthey\\'ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during \\nyour private session with the Gamemakers, show \\nthem what you can do. Until then, stay clear of \\narchery. Are you any good at trapping?\" \\n\\n\"I know a few basic snares,\" I mutter. \\n\\n\"That may be significant in terms of food,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"And Peeta, she\\'s right, never \\nunderestimate strength in the arena. Very often, \\nphysical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the \\nTraining Center, they will have weights, but don\\'t \\nreveal how much you can lift in front of the other \\ntributes. The plan\\'s the same for both of you. You go \\nto group training. Spend the time trying to learn \\nsomething you don\\'t know. Throw a spear. Swing a \\nmace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what \\nyou\\'re best at until your private sessions. Are we \\nclear?\" says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod. \\n87 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"One last thing. In public, I want you by each other\\'s \\nside every minute,\" says Haymitch. We both start to \\nobject, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. \\n\"Every minute! It\\'s not open for discussion! You \\nagreed to do as I said! You will be together, you will \\nappear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie \\nat the elevator at ten for training.\" \\n\\nI bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure \\nPeeta can hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating \\nHaymitch, hating Peeta, hating myself for mentioning \\nthat day long ago in the rain. \\n\\nIt\\'s such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to \\nbe friends! Talking up each other\\'s strengths, \\ninsisting the other take credit for their abilities. \\nBecause, in fact, at some point, we\\'re going to have to \\nknock it off and accept we\\'re bitter adversaries. Which \\nI\\'d be prepared to do right now if it wasn\\'t for \\nHaymitch\\'s stupid instruction that we stick together \\nin training. It\\'s my own fault, I guess, for telling him \\nhe didn\\'t have to coach us separately. But that didn\\'t \\nmean I wanted to do everything with Peeta. Who, by \\nthe way, clearly doesn\\'t want to be partnering up with \\nme, either. \\n\\nI hear Peeta\\'s voice in my head. She has no idea. The \\neffect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. \\nRight? but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a \\ncompliment. That he meant I was appealing in some \\nway. It\\'s weird, how much he\\'s noticed me. Like the \\nattention he\\'s paid to my hunting. And apparently, I \\nhave not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, \\neither. The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of \\nthe boy with the bread. \\n\\nIt\\'s almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my \\nhair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my \\nnervousness about meeting the other tributes, but \\n88 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nnow I can feel my anxiety rising again. By the time I \\nmeet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself \\nbiting my nails. I stop at once. \\n\\nThe actual training rooms are below ground level of \\nour building. With these elevators, the ride is less \\nthan a minute. The doors open into an enormous \\ngymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle \\ncourses. Although it\\'s not yet ten, we\\'re the last ones \\nto arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense \\ncircle. They each have a cloth square with their \\ndistrict number on it pinned to their shirts. While \\nsomeone pins the number 12 on my back, I do a quick \\nassessment. Peeta and I are the only two dressed \\nalike. \\n\\nAs soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, \\nathletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to \\nexplain the training schedule. Experts in each skill \\nwill remain at their stations. We will be free to travel \\nfrom area to area as we choose, per our mentor\\'s \\ninstructions. Some of the stations teach survival \\nskills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to \\nengage in any combative exercise with another \\ntribute. There are assistants on hand if we want to \\npractice with a partner. \\n\\nWhen Atala begins to read down the list of the skill \\nstations, my eyes can\\'t help flitting around to the \\nother tributes. It\\'s the first time we\\'ve been \\nassembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My \\nheart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of \\nthe girls are bigger than I am, even though many of \\nthe tributes have never been fed properly. You can see \\nit in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their \\neyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my \\nfamily\\'s resourcefulness has given me an edge in that \\narea. I stand straight, and while I\\'m thin, I\\'m strong. \\nThe meat and plants from the woods combined with \\n89 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe exertion it took to get them have given me a \\nhealthier body than most of those I see around me. \\n\\nThe exceptions are the kids from the wealthier \\ndistricts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed \\nand trained throughout their lives for this moment. \\nThe tributes from 1,2, and 4 traditionally have this \\nlook about them. It\\'s technically against the rules to \\ntrain tributes before they reach the Capitol but it \\nhappens every year. In District 12, we call them the \\nCareer Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, \\nthe winner will be one of them. \\n\\nThe slight advantage I held coming into the Training \\nCenter, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish \\nin the presence of my competition. The other tributes \\nwere jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, \\nbecause our stylists were. Now I see nothing but \\ncontempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each \\nmust have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They \\nproject arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases \\nus, they head straight for the deadliest-looking \\nweapons in the gym and handle them with ease. \\n\\nI\\'m thinking that it\\'s lucky I\\'m a fast runner when \\nPeeta nudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside \\nme, per Haymitch\\'s instructions. His expression is \\nsober. \"Where would you like to start?\" \\n\\nI look around at the Career Tributes who are showing \\noff, clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the \\nothers, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having \\ntheir first lessons with a knife or an ax. \\n\\n\"Suppose we tie some knots,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Right you are,\" says Peeta. We cross to an empty \\nstation where the trainer seems pleased to have \\nstudents. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class \\n90 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nis not the Hunger games hot spot. When he realizes I \\nknow something about snares, he shows us a simple, \\nexcellent trap that will leave a human competitor \\ndangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this \\none skill for an hour until both of us have mastered \\nit. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely \\nseems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of \\nmud and clay and berry juices around on his pale \\nskin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The \\ntrainer who runs the camouflage station is full of \\nenthusiasm at his work. \\n\\n\"I do the cakes,\" he admits to me. \\n\\n\"The cakes?\" I ask. I\\'ve been preoccupied with \\nwatching the boy from District 2 send a spear \\nthrough a dummy\\'s heart from fifteen yards. \"What \\ncakes?\" \\n\\n\"At home. The iced ones, for the bakery,\" he says. \\n\\nHe means the ones they display in the windows. \\nFancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in \\nfrosting. They\\'re for birthdays and New Year\\'s Day. \\nWhen we\\'re in the square, Prim always drags me over \\nto admire them, although we\\'d never be able to afford \\none. There\\'s little enough beauty in District 12, \\nthough, so I can hardly deny her this. \\n\\nI look more critically at the design on Peeta\\'s arm. The \\nalternating pattern of light and dark suggests \\nsunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I \\nwonder how he knows this, since I doubt he\\'s ever \\nbeen beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this \\nup from just that scraggly old apple tree in his \\nbackyard? Somehow the whole thing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his skill, \\nthose inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage \\nexpert \\xe2\\x80\\x94 annoys me. \\n\\n\\n\\n91 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,\"I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be so superior. You can never tell what you 11 \\nfind in the arena. Say it\\'s actually a gigantic cake \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\nbegins Peeta. \\n\\n\"Say we move on,\" I break in. \\n\\nSo the next three days pass with Peeta and I going \\nquietly from station to station. We do pick up some \\nvaluable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, \\nto making shelter. Despite Haymitch\\'s order to appear \\nmediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I \\nsweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. \\nWe steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, \\nwanting to save those for our private sessions. \\n\\nThe Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. \\nTwenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple \\nrobes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround \\nthe gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch \\nus, jotting down notes, other times eating at the \\nendless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring \\nthe lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye \\non the District 12 tributes. Several times I\\'ve looked \\nup to find one fixated on me. They consult with the \\ntrainers during our meals as well. We see them all \\ngathered together when we come back. \\n\\nBreakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at \\nlunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off \\nthe gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the \\nroom and you serve yourself. The Career Tributes \\ntend to gather rowdily around one table, as if to prove \\ntheir superiority, that they have no fear of one \\nanother and consider the rest of us beneath notice. \\nMost of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No \\none says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and \\n92 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsince Haymitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep \\nup a friendly conversation during the meals. \\n\\nIt\\'s not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is \\npainful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, \\nPeeta empties our breadbasket and points out how \\nthey have been careful to include types from the \\ndistricts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. \\nThe fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from \\nDistrict 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds \\nfrom District 1 1 . Somehow, although it\\'s made from \\nthe same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the \\nugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home. \\n\\n\"And there you have it,\" says Peeta, scooping the \\nbreads back in the basket. \\n\\n\"You certainly know a lot,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Only about bread,\" he says. \"Okay, now laugh as if \\nI\\'ve said something funny.\" \\n\\nWe both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore \\nthe stares from around the room. \\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll keep smiling pleasantly and you \\ntalk,\"says Peeta. It\\'s wearing us both out, Haymitch \\'s \\ndirection to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed \\nmy door, there\\'s been a chill in the air between us. \\nBut we have our orders. \\n\\n\"Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a \\nbear?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"No, but it sounds fascinating,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true \\nstory, in which I\\'d foolishly challenged a black bear \\nover the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks \\n\\n\\n\\n93 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nquestions right on cue. He\\'s much better at this than \\nI am. \\n\\nOn the second day, while we\\'re taking a shot at spear \\nthrowing, he whispers to me. \"I think we have a \\nshadow.\" \\n\\nI throw my spear, which I\\'m not too bad at actually, if \\nI don\\'t have to throw too far, and see the little girl \\nfrom District 1 1 standing back a bit, watching us. \\nShe\\'s the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me \\nso of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. \\nShe has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown skin and \\nstands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly \\nextended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the \\nslightest sound. It\\'s impossible not to think of a bird. \\n\\nI pick up another spear while Peeta throws. \"I think \\nher name\\'s Rue,\" he says softly. \\n\\nI bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows \\nin the Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could \\ntip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet. \\n\\n\"What can we do about it?\" I ask him, more harshly \\nthan I intended. \\n\\n\"Nothing to do,\" he says back. \"Just making \\nconversation.\" \\n\\nNow that I know she\\'s there, it\\'s hard to ignore the \\nchild. She slips up and joins us at different stations. \\nLike me, she\\'s clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and \\nhas good aim. She can hit the target every time with a \\nslingshot. But what is a slingshot against a 220- \\npound male with a sword? \\n\\nBack on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill \\nus throughout breakfast and dinner about every \\n\\n\\n\\n94 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmoment of the day. What we did, who watched us, \\nhow the other tributes size up. Cinna and Portia \\naren\\'t around, so there\\'s no one to add any sanity to \\nthe meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting \\nanymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, \\ndetermined to whip us into shape. Full of endless \\ndirections about what we should do and not do in \\ntraining. Peeta is more patient, but I become fed up \\nand surly. \\n\\nWhen we finally escape to bed on the second night, \\nPeeta mumbles, \"Someone ought to get Haymitch a \\ndrink.\" \\n\\nI make a sound that is somewhere between a snort \\nand a laugh. Then catch myself. It\\'s messing with my \\nmind too much, trying to keep straight when we\\'re \\nsupposedly friends and when we\\'re not. At least when \\nwe get into the arena, 111 know where we stand. \\n\"Don\\'t. Don\\'t let\\'s pretend when there\\'s no one \\naround.\" \\n\\n\"All right, Katniss,\" he says tiredly. After that, we only \\ntalk in front of people. \\n\\nOn the third day of training, they start to call us out \\nof lunch for our private sessions with the \\nGamemakers. District by district, first the boy, then \\nthe girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is slated to go \\nlast. We linger in the dining room, unsure where else \\nto go. No one comes back once they have left. As the \\nroom empties, the pressure to appear friendly \\nlightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone. \\nWe sit in silence until they summon Peeta. He rises. \\n\\n\"Remember what Haymitch said about being sure to \\nthrow the weights.\" The words come out of my mouth \\nwithout permission. \\n\\n\\n\\n95 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thanks. I will,\" he says. \"You ... shoot straight.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nI nod. I don\\'t know why I said anything at all. \\nAlthough if I\\'m going to lose, I\\'d rather Peeta win than \\nthe others. Better for our district, for my mother and \\nPrim. \\n\\nAfter about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I \\nsmooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk \\ninto the gymnasium. Instantly, I know I\\'m in trouble. \\nThey\\'ve been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat \\nthrough twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too \\nmuch to wine, most of them. Want more than \\nanything to go home. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I \\nwalk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I\\'ve \\nbeen itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows \\nmade of wood and plastic and metal and materials I \\ncan\\'t even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless \\nuniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the \\nmatching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There\\'s \\na shooting range, but it\\'s much too limited. Standard \\nbull\\'s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the \\ncenter of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The \\ndummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on \\nthe bow I know something is wrong. The string\\'s \\ntighter than the one I use at home. The arrow\\'s more \\nrigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and \\nlose what little attention I had been commanding. For \\na moment, I\\'m humiliated, then I head back to the \\nbull\\'s-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel \\nof these new weapons. \\n\\nBack in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial \\nposition and skewer the dummy right through the \\nheart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag \\nfor boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the \\nground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, \\n\\n\\n\\n96 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncome up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of \\nthe hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A \\nshower of sparks bursts from the fixture. \\n\\nIt\\'s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A \\nfew are nodding approval, but the majority of them \\nare fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their \\nbanquet table. \\n\\nSuddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, \\nthey don\\'t even have the decency to pay attention to \\nme. That I\\'m being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart \\nstarts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without \\nthinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it \\nstraight at the Gamemakers\\' table. I hear shouts of \\nalarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the \\napple in the pig\\'s mouth and pins it to the wall \\nbehind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. \\n\\n\"Thank you for your consideration,\" I say. Then I give \\na slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without \\nbeing dismissed. \\n\\n\\n\\n97 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\nAs I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one \\nside and my quiver to the other. I brush past the \\ngaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the \\nnumber twelve button with my fist. The doors slide \\ntogether and I zip upward. I actually make it back to \\nmy floor before the tears start running down my \\ncheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the \\nsitting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, \\nbolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then I \\nreally begin to sob. \\n\\nNow I\\'ve done it! Now I\\'ve ruined everything! If I\\'d \\nstood even a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent \\nthat arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they \\ndo to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my \\ntongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the \\nfuture tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, \\nshooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn\\'t, I \\nwas shooting at that apple because I was so angry at \\nbeing ignored. I wasn\\'t trying to kill one of them. If I \\nwere, they\\'d be dead! \\n\\nOh, what does it matter? It\\'s not like I was going to \\nwin the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to \\nme? What really scares me is what they might do to \\nmy mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now \\nbecause of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few \\nbelongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to \\nthe community home, or kill them? They wouldn\\'t kill \\nthem, would they? Why not? What do they care? \\n\\nI should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like \\nit was a big joke. Then maybe I would have found \\n\\n\\n\\n98 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsome leniency. But instead I stalked out of the place \\nin the most disrespectful manner possible. \\n\\nHaymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout \\nfor them to go away and eventually they do. It takes \\nat least an hour for me to cry myself out. Then I just \\nlay curled up on the bed, stroking the silken sheets, \\nwatching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol. \\n\\nAt first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time \\npasses, it seems less likely. I calm down. They still \\nneed a girl tribute from District 12, don\\'t they? If the \\nGamemakers want to punish me, they can do it \\npublicly. Wait until I\\'m in the arena and sic starving \\nwild animals on me. You can bet they\\'ll make sure I \\ndon\\'t have a bow and arrow to defend myself. \\n\\nBefore that though, they\\'ll give me a score so low, no \\none in their right mind would sponsor me. That\\'s \\nwhat will happen tonight. Since the training isn\\'t \\nopen to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score \\nfor each player. It gives the audience a starting place \\nfor the betting that will continue throughout the \\nGames. The number, which is between one and \\ntwelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being \\nunattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. \\nThe mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. \\nIt\\'s only an indication of the potential a tribute \\nshowed in training. Often, because of the variables in \\nthe actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down \\nalmost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who \\nwon the Games only received a three. Still, the scores \\ncan help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of \\nsponsorship. I had been hoping my shooting skills \\nmight get me a six or a seven, even if I\\'m not \\nparticularly powerful. Now I\\'m sure 111 have the \\nlowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors \\nme, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero. \\n\\n\\n\\n99 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I \\ndecide I may as well go. The scores will be televised \\ntonight. It\\'s not like I can hide what happened forever. \\nI go to the bathroom and wash my face, but it\\'s still \\nred and splotchy. \\n\\nEveryone\\'s waiting at the table, even Cinna and \\nPortia. I wish the stylists hadn\\'t shown up because \\nfor some reason, I don\\'t like the idea of disappointing \\nthem. It\\'s as if I\\'ve thrown away all the good work \\nthey did on the opening ceremonies without a \\nthought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny \\nspoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of \\nmy tears. \\n\\nThe adults begin some chitchat about the weather \\nforecast, and I let my eyes meet Peeta\\'s. He raises his \\neyebrows. A question. What happened? I just give my \\nhead a small shake. Then, as they\\'re serving the main \\ncourse, I hear Haymitch say, \"Okay, enough small \\ntalk, just how bad were you today?\" \\n\\nPeeta jumps in. \"I don\\'t know that it mattered. By the \\ntime I showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. \\nThey were singing some kind of drinking song, I \\nthink. So, I threw around some heavy objects until \\nthey told me I could go.\" \\n\\nThat makes me feel a bit better. It\\'s not like Peeta \\nattacked the Gamemakers, but at least he was \\nprovoked, too. \\n\\n\"And you, sweetheart?\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nSomehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me \\noff enough that I\\'m at least able to speak. \"I shot an \\narrow at the Gamemakers.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n100 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nEveryone stops eating. \"You what?\" The horror in \\nEffie\\'s voice confirms my worse suspicions. \\n\\n\"I shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their \\ndirection. It\\'s like Peeta said, I was shooting and they \\nwere ignoring me and I just ... I just lost my head, so I \\nshot an apple out of their stupid roast pig\\'s mouth!\" I \\nsay defiantly. \\n\\n\"And what did they say?\" says Cinna carefully. \\n\\n\"Nothing. Or I don\\'t know. I walked out after that,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Without being dismissed?\" gasps Effie. \\n\\n\"I dismissed myself,\" I said. I remember how I \\npromised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel \\nlike a ton of coal has dropped on me. \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s that,\"says Haymitch. Then he butters a \\nroll. \\n\\n\"Do you think they 11 arrest me?\" I ask. \"Doubt it. Be a \\npain to replace you at this stage, \"says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"What about my family?\"Isay. \"Will they punish \\nthem?\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t think so. Wouldn\\'t make much sense. See \\nthey\\'d have to reveal what happened in the Training \\nCenter for it to have any worthwhile effect on the \\npopulation. People would need to know what you did. \\nBut they can\\'t since it\\'s secret, so it\\'d be a waste of \\neffort,\" says Haymitch. \"More likely they\\'ll make your \\nlife hell in the arena.\" \\n\\n\"Well, they\\'ve already promised to do that to us any \\nway,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n101 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very true,\" says Haymitch. And I realize the \\nimpossible has happened. They have actually cheered \\nme up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his \\nfingers, which makes Effie frown, and dunks it in his \\nwine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to \\nchuckle. \"What were their faces like?\" \\n\\nI can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. \"Shocked. \\nTerrified. Uh, ridiculous, some of them.\" An image \\npops into my mind. \"One man tripped backward into \\na bowl of punch.\" \\n\\nHaymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except \\nEffie, although even she is suppressing a smile. \"Well, \\nit serves them right. It\\'s their job to pay attention to \\nyou. And just because you come from District Twelve \\nis no excuse to ignore you.\" Then her eyes dart \\naround as if she\\'s said something totally \\noutrageous. \"I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s what I think,\" she \\nsays to no one in particular. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll get a very bad score,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Scores only matter if they\\'re very good, no one pays \\nmuch attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all \\nthey know, you could be hiding your talents to get a \\nlow score on purpose. People use that strategy,\" said \\nPortia. \\n\\n\"I hope that\\'s how people interpret the four I\\'ll \\nprobably get,\" says Peeta. \"If that. Really, is anything \\nless impressive than watching a person pick up a \\nheavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost \\nlanded on my foot.\" \\n\\nI grin at him and realize that I\\'m starving. I cut off a \\npiece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start \\neating. It\\'s okay. My family is safe. And if they are \\nsafe, no real harm has been done. \\n\\n\\n\\n102 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores \\nannounced on television. First they show a photo of \\nthe tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career \\nTributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most \\nof the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little \\nRue comes up with a seven. I don\\'t know what she \\nshowed the judges, but she\\'s so tiny it must have \\nbeen impressive. \\n\\nDistrict 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an \\neight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must \\nhave been watching him. I dig my fingernails into my \\npalms as my face comes up, expecting the worst. \\nThen they\\'re flashing the number eleven on the \\nscreen. \\n\\nEleven! \\n\\nEffie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is \\nslapping me on the back and cheering and \\ncongratulating me. But it doesn\\'t seem real. \\n\\n\"There must be a mistake. How ... how could that \\nhappen?\" I ask Haymitch. \\n\\n\"Guess they liked your temper,\" he says. \"They\\'ve got \\na show to put on. They need some players with some \\nheat.\" \\n\\n\"Katniss, the girl who was on fire,\" says Cinna and \\ngives me a hug. \"Oh, wait until you see your interview \\ndress.\" \"More flames?\" I ask. \"Of a sort,\" he says \\nmischievously. \\n\\nPeeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward \\nmoment. We\\'ve both done well, but what does that \\nmean for the other? I escape to my room as quickly as \\npossible and burrow down under the covers. The \\nstress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me \\n\\n103 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nout. I drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the \\nnumber eleven still flashing behind my eyelids. \\n\\nAt dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun \\ncome up on a beautiful morning. It\\'s Sunday. A day \\noff at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. \\nUsually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the \\nweek. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then \\ntrading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both \\nof us can hunt alone, but we\\'re better as a pair. \\nParticularly if we\\'re trying for bigger game. But also in \\nthe littler things, having a partner lightened the load, \\ncould even make the arduous task of filling my \\nfamily\\'s table enjoyable. \\n\\nI had been struggling along on my own for about six \\nmonths when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was \\na Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with \\ndying things. I\\'d spent the morning competing with \\nthe squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer \\nafternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting \\nkatniss. The only meat I\\'d shot was a squirrel that \\nhad practically run over my toes in its quest for \\nacorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the \\nsnow buried my other food sources. Having strayed \\nfarther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, \\nlugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead \\nrabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot \\nabove my head. About fifteen yards away was \\nanother. I recognized the twitch-up snares because \\nmy father had used them. When the prey is caught, \\nit\\'s yanked into the air out of the reach of other \\nhungry animals. I\\'d been trying to use snares all \\nsummer with no success, so I couldn\\'t help dropping \\nmy sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on \\nthe wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang \\nout. \"That\\'s dangerous.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n104 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from \\nbehind a tree. He must have been watching me the \\nwhole time. He was only fourteen, but he cleared six \\nfeet and was as good as an adult to me. I\\'d seen him \\naround the Seam and at school. And one other time. \\nHe\\'d lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. \\nIn January, I\\'d stood by while he received his medal \\nof valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child \\nwith no father. I remembered his two little brothers \\nclutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly \\nannounced she was just days away from giving birth. \\n\\n\"What\\'s your name?\" he said, coming over and \\ndisengaging the rabbit from the snare. He had \\nanother three hanging from his belt. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" I said, barely audible. \\n\\n\"Well, Catnip, stealing\\'s punishable by death, or \\nhadn\\'t you heard?\" he said. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" I said louder. \"And I wasn\\'t stealing it. I \\njust wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch \\nanything.\" \\n\\nHe scowled at me, not convinced. \"So where\\'d you get \\nthe squirrel?\" \\n\\n\"I shot it.\" I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still \\nusing the small version my father had made me, but \\nI\\'d been practicing with the full-size one when I could. \\nI was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring \\ndown some bigger game. \\n\\nGale\\'s eyes fastened on the bow. \"Can I see that?\" I \\nhanded it over. \"Just remember, stealing\\'s punishable \\nby death.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n105 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the first time I ever saw him smile. It \\ntransformed him from someone menacing to someone \\nyou wished you knew. But it took several months \\nbefore I returned that smile. \\n\\nWe talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to \\nget him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. \\nI wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares \\nthat caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed \\nsomething might be worked out. As the seasons went \\nby, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our \\nweapons, our secret places that were thick with wild \\nplums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. I \\nshowed him what plants to eat and eventually gave \\nhim one of our precious bows. And then one day, \\nwithout either of us saying it, we became a team. \\nDividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that \\nboth our families had food. \\n\\nGale gave me a sense of securityl\\'dlacked since my \\nfather\\'s death. His companionship replaced the long \\nsolitary hours in the woods. I became a much better \\nhunter when I didn\\'t have to look over my shoulder \\nconstantly, when someone was watching my back. \\nBut he turned into so much more than a hunting \\npartner. He became my confidante, someone with \\nwhom I could share thoughts I could never voice \\ninside the fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. \\nBeing out in the woods with Gale . . . sometimes I was \\nactually happy. \\n\\nI call him my friend, but in the last year it\\'s seemed \\ntoo casual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of \\nlonging shoots through my chest. If only he was with \\nme now! But, of course, I don\\'t want that. I don\\'t want \\nhim in the arena where he\\'d be dead in a few days. I \\njust ... I just miss him. And I hate being so alone. \\nDoes he miss me? He must. \\n\\n\\n\\n106 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI think of the eleven flashing under my name last \\nnight. I know exactly what he\\'d say to me. \"Well, \\nthere\\'s some room for improvement there.\" And then \\nhe\\'d give me a smile and I\\'d return it without \\nhesitating now. \\n\\nI can\\'t help comparing what I have with Gale to what \\nI\\'m pretending to have with Peeta. How I never \\nquestion Gale\\'s motives while I do nothing but doubt \\nthe latter\\'s. It\\'s not a fair comparison really. Gale and \\nI were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. \\nPeeta and I know the other\\'s survival means our own \\ndeath. How do you sidestep that? \\n\\nEffie\\'s knocking at the door, reminding me there\\'s \\nanother \"big, big, big day!\" ahead. Tomorrow night \\nwill be our televised interviews. I guess the whole \\nteam will have their hands full readying us for that. \\n\\nI get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more \\ncareful about the buttons I hit, and head down to the \\ndining room. Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled \\naround the table talking in hushed voices. That \\nseems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity and I \\nload up my plate with breakfast before I join them. \\n\\nThe stew\\'s made with tender chunks of lamb and \\ndried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. I\\'ve \\nshoveled about halfway through the mound when I \\nrealize no one\\'s talking. I take a big gulp of orange \\njuice and wipe my mouth. \"So, what\\'s going on? \\nYou\\'re coaching us on interviews today, right?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"You don\\'t have to wait until I\\'m done. I can listen \\nand cat at the same time,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n107 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s been a change of plans. About our \\ncurrent approach,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" I ask. I\\'m not sure what our current \\napproach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the \\nother tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember. \\n\\nHaymitch shrugs. \"Peeta has asked to be coached \\nseparately.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n108 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nBetrayal. That\\'s the first thing I feel, which is \\nludicrous. For there to be betrayal, there would have \\nhad to been trust first. Between Peeta and me. And \\ntrust has not been part of the agreement. We\\'re \\ntributes. But the boy who risked a beating to give me \\nbread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who \\ncovered for me with the redheaded Avox girl, who \\ninsisted Haymitch know my hunting skills . . . was \\nthere some part of me that couldn\\'t help trusting \\nhim? \\n\\nOn the other hand, I\\'m relieved that we can stop the \\npretense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin \\nconnection we\\'d foolishly formed has been severed. \\nAnd high time, too. The Games begin in two days, and \\ntrust will only be a weakness. Whatever triggered \\nPeeta\\'s decision \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I suspect it had to do with my \\noutperforming him in training \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I should be nothing \\nbut grateful for it. Maybe he\\'s finally accepted the fact \\nthat the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are \\nenemies, the better. \\n\\n\"Good,\" I say. \"So what\\'s the schedule?\" \\n\\n\"Youll each have four hours with Effie for \\npresentation and four with me for content,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"You start with Effie, Katniss.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t imagine what Effie will have to teach me that \\ncould take four hours, but she\\'s got me working down \\nto the last minute. We go to my rooms and she puts \\nme inafull-length gown and high-heeled shoes, not \\nthe ones I\\'ll he wearing for the actual interview, and \\ninstructs me on walking. The shoes are the worst \\n\\n\\n\\n109 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\npart. I\\'ve never worn high heels and can\\'t get used to \\nessentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet. \\nBut Effie runs around in them full-time, and I\\'m \\ndetermined that if she can do it, so can I. The dress \\nposes another problem. It keeps tangling around my \\nshoes so, of course, I hitch it up, and then Effie \\nswoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my hands \\nand yelling, \"Not above the ankle!\" When I finally \\nconquer walking, there\\'s still sitting, posture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\napparently I have a tendency to duck my head \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eye \\ncontact, hand gestures, and smiling. Smiling is \\nmostly about smiling more. Effie makes me say a \\nhundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while \\nsmiling, or ending with a smile. By lunch, the \\nmuscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse. \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s the best I can do,\" Effie says with a sigh. \\n\"Just remember, Katniss, you want the audience to \\nlike you.\" \\n\\n\"And you don\\'t think they will?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not if you glare at them the entire time. Why don\\'t \\nyou save that for the arena? Instead, think of yourself \\namong friends, \"says Effie. \\n\\n\"They\\'re betting on how long I\\'ll live!\" I burst \\nout. \"They\\'re not my friends!\" \\n\\n\"Well, try and pretend!\" snaps Effie. Then she \\ncomposes herself and beams at me. \"See, like this. I\\'m \\nsmiling at you even though you\\'re aggravating me.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, it feels very convincing,\" I say. \"I\\'m going to eat.\" \\n1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining \\nroom, hiking my skirt up to my thighs. \\n\\nPeeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so \\nI\\'m thinking the content session should be an \\n\\n110 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nimprovement over the morning. I couldn\\'t be more \\nwrong. After lunch, Haymitch takes me into the \\nsitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just \\nfrowns at me for a while. \\n\\n\"What?\" I finally ask. \\n\\n\"I\\'m trying to figure out what to do with you,\" he \\nsays. \"How we\\'re going to present you. Are you going \\nto be charming? Aloof? Fierce? So far, you\\'re shining \\nlike a star. You volunteered to save your sister. Cinna \\nmade you look unforgettable. You\\'ve got the top \\ntraining score. People are intrigued, but no one knows \\nwho you are. The impression you make tomorrow will \\ndecide exactly what I can get you in terms of \\nsponsors,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nHaving watched the tribute interviews all my life, I \\nknow there\\'s truth to what he\\'s saying. If you appeal \\nto the crowd, either by being humorous or brutal or \\neccentric, you gain favor. \\n\\n\"What\\'s Peeta\\'s approach? Or am I not allowed to \\nask?\" I say. \\n\\n\"Likable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor \\nnaturally,\" says Haymitch. \"Whereas when you open \\nyour mouth, you come across more as sullen and \\nhostile.\" \\n\\n\"I do not!\" I say. \\n\\n\"Please. I don\\'t know where you pulled that cheery, \\nwavy girl on the chariot from, but I haven\\'t seen her \\nbefore or since,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"And you\\'ve given me so many reasons to be cheery,\" I \\ncounter. \\n\\n\\n\\nIll | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you don\\'t have to please me. I\\'m not going to \\nsponsor you. So pretend I\\'m the audience,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"Delight me.\" \\n\\n\"Fine!\" I snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the \\ninterviewer and I try to answer his questions in a \\nwinning fashion. But I can\\'t. I\\'m too angry with \\nHaymitch for what he said and that I even have to \\nanswer the questions. All I can think is how unjust \\nthe whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I \\nhopping around like some trained dog trying to please \\npeople I hate? The longer the interview goes on, the \\nmore my fury seems to rise to the surface, until I\\'m \\nliterally spitting out answers at him. \\n\\n\"All right, enough,\" he says. \"We\\'ve got to find another \\nangle. Not only are you hostile, I don\\'t know anything \\nabout you. I\\'ve asked you fifty questions and still have \\nno sense of your life, your family, what you care \\nabout. They want to know about you, Katniss.\" \\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want them to! They\\'re already taking my \\nfuture! They can\\'t have the things that mattered to \\nme in the past!\" I say. \\n\\n\"Then lie! Make something up!\" says Haymitch. \\n\"I\\'m not good at lying,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Well, you better learn fast. You\\'ve got about as much \\ncharm as a dead slug,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nOuch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know he\\'s \\nbeen too harsh because his voice softens. \"Here\\'s an \\nidea. Try acting humble.\" \\n\\n\"Humble,\" I echo. \\n\\n\\n\\n112 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"That you can\\'t believe a little girl from District Twelve \\nhas done this well. The whole thing\\'s been more than \\nyou ever could have dreamed of. Talk about Cinna\\'s \\nclothes. How nice the people are. How the city amazes \\nyou. If you won\\'t talk about yourself, at least \\ncompliment the audience. Just keep turning it back \\naround, all right. Gush.\" \\n\\nThe next hours are agonizing. At once, it\\'s clear I \\ncannot gush. We try me playing cocky, but I just don\\'t \\nhave the arrogance. Apparently, I\\'m too \"vulnerable\" \\nfor ferocity. I\\'m not witty. Funny. Sexy. Or \\nmysterious. \\n\\nBy the end of the session, I am no one at all. \\nHaymitch started drinking somewhere around witty, \\nand a nasty edge has crept into his voice. \"I give up, \\nsweetheart. Just answer the questions and try not to \\nlet the audience see how openly you despise them.\" \\n\\nI have dinner that night in my room, ordering an \\noutrageous number of delicacies, eating myself sick, \\nand then taking out my anger at Haymitch, at the \\nHunger Games, at every living being in the Capitol by \\nsmashing dishes around my room. When the girl with \\nthe red hair comes in to turn down my bed, her eyes \\nwiden at the mess. \"Just leave it!\" I yell at her. \"Just \\nleave it alone!\" \\n\\nI hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes \\nthat call me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the \\nCapitol, both now and then. For her, justice must \\nfinally be happening. At least my death will help pay \\nfor the life of the boy in the woods. \\n\\nBut instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the \\ndoor behind her and goes to the bathroom. She comes \\nback with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently \\n\\n\\n\\n113 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthen cleans the blood from a broken plate off my \\nhands. Why is she doing this? Why am I letting her? \\n\\n\"I should have tried to save you,\" I whisper. \\n\\nShe shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to \\nstand by? That she has forgiven me? \\n\\n\"No, it was wrong,\" I say. \\n\\nShe taps her lips with her fingers then points to my \\nchest. I think she means that I would just have ended \\nup an Avox, too. Probably would have. An Avox or \\ndead. \\n\\nI spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl \\nclean the room. When all the garbage has been \\ndropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away, \\nshe turns down my bed. I crawl in between the sheets \\nlike a five-year-old and let her tuck me in. Then she \\ngoes. I want her to stay until I fall asleep. To be there \\nwhen I wake up. I want the protection of this girl, \\neven though she never had mine. \\n\\nIn the morning, it\\'s not the girl but my prep team who \\nare hanging over me. My lessons with Effie and \\nHaymitch are over. This day belongs to Cinna. He\\'s \\nmy last hope. Maybe he can make me look so \\nwonderful, no one will care what comes out of my \\nmouth. \\n\\nThe team works on me until late afternoon, turning \\nmy skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my \\narms, painting flame designs on my twenty perfect \\nnails. Then Venia goes to work on my hair, weaving \\nstrands of red into a pattern that begins at my left \\near, wraps around my head, and then falls in one \\nbraid down my right shoulder. They erase my face \\nwith a layer of pale makeup and draw my features \\n\\n\\n\\n114 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nback out. Huge dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that \\nthrow off bits of light when I blink. Finally, they cover \\nmy entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer \\nin gold dust. \\n\\nThen Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, \\nbut I can\\'t really see it because it\\'s covered. \"Close \\nyour eyes,\" he orders. \\n\\nI can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over \\nmy naked body, then the weight. It must be forty \\npounds. I clutch Octavia\\'s hand as I blindly step into \\nmy shoes, glad to find they are at least two inches \\nlower than the pair Effie had me practice in. There\\'s \\nsome adjusting and fidgeting. Then silence. \\n\\n\"Can I open my eyes?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Yes,\" says Cinna. \"Open them.\" \\n\\nThe creature standing before me in the full-length \\nmirror has come from another world. Where skin \\nshimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make \\ntheir clothes from jewels. Because my dress, oh, my \\ndress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems, \\nred and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent \\nthe tips of the flame design. The slightest movement \\ngives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire. \\n\\nI am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as \\nthe sun. \\n\\nFor a while, we all just stare at me. \"Oh, Cinna,\" I \\nfinally whisper. \"Thank you.\" \\n\\n\"Twirl for me,\" he says. I hold out my arms and spin \\nin a circle. The prep team screams in admiration. \\n\\n\\n\\n115 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nCinna dismisses the team and has me move around \\nin the dress and shoes, which are infinitely more \\nmanageable than Effie\\'s. The dress hangs in such a \\nway that I don\\'t have to lift the skirt when I walk, \\nleaving me with one less thing to worry about. \\n\\n\"So, all ready for the interview then?\" asks Cinna. I \\ncan see by his expression that he\\'s been talking to \\nHaymitch. That he knows how dreadful I am. \\n\\n\"I\\'m awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No \\nmatter what we tried, I couldn\\'t do it. I just can\\'t be \\none of those people he wants me to be,\" I say. \\n\\nCinna thinks about this a moment. \"Why don\\'t you \\njust be yourself?\" \\n\\n\"Myself? That\\'s no good, either. Haymitch says I\\'m \\nsullen and hostile,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Well, you are ... around Haymitch,\" says Cinna with \\na grin. \"I don\\'t find you so. The prep team adores you. \\nYou even won over the Gamemakers. And as for the \\ncitizens of the Capitol, well, they can\\'t stop talking \\nabout you. No one can help but admire your spirit.\" \\n\\nMy spirit. This is a new thought. I\\'m not sure exactly \\nwhat it means, but it suggests I\\'m a fighter. In a sort \\nof brave way. It\\'s not as if I\\'m never friendly. Okay, \\nmaybe I don\\'t go around loving everybody I meet, \\nmaybe my smiles are hard to come by, but I do care \\nfor some people. \\n\\nCinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. \\n\"Suppose, when you answer the questions, you think \\nyou\\'re addressing a friend back home. Who would \\nyour best friend be?\" asks Cinna. \\n\\n\\n\\n116 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gale,\" I say instantly. \"Only it doesn\\'t make sense, \\nCinna. I would never be telling Gale those things \\nabout me. He already knows them.\" \\n\\n\"What about me? Could you think of me as a friend?\" \\nasks Cinna. \\n\\nOf all the people I\\'ve met since I left home, Cinna is \\nby far my favorite. I liked him right off and he hasn\\'t \\ndisappointed me yet. \"I think so, but \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be sitting on the main platform with the other \\nstylists. You\\'ll be able to look right at me. When \\nyou\\'re asked a question, find me, and answer it as \\nhonestly as possible,\" says Cinna. \\n\\n\"Even if what I think is horrible?\" I ask. Because it \\nmight be, really. \\n\\n\"Especially if what you think is horrible,\" says \\nCinna. \"Youll try it?\" \\n\\nI nod. It\\'s a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at. \\n\\nToo soon it\\'s time to go. The interviews take place on \\na stage constructed in front of the Training Center. \\nOnce I leave my room, it will be only minutes until I\\'m \\nin front of the crowd, the cameras, all of Panem. \\n\\nAs Cinna turns the doorknob, I stop his hand. \"Cinna \\n...\" I\\'m completely overcome with stage fright. \\n\\n\"Remember, they already love you,\" he says gently. \\n\"Just be yourself.\" \\n\\nWe meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at \\nthe elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at \\nwork. Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame \\naccents. While we look well together, it\\'s a relief not to \\n\\n\\n\\n117 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nbe dressed identically. Haymitch and Effie are all \\nfancied up for the occasion. I avoid Haymitch, but \\naccept Effie \\'s compliments. Effie can be tiresome and \\nclueless, but she\\'s not destructive like Haymitch. \\n\\nWhen the elevator opens, the other tributes are being \\nlined up to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in \\na big arc throughout the interviews. Ill be last, or \\nsecond to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy \\nfrom each district. How I wish I could be first and get \\nthe whole thing out of the way! Now 111 have to listen \\nto how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and charming \\neverybody else is before I go up. Plus, the audience \\nwill start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. \\nAnd I can\\'t exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to \\nget their attention. \\n\\nRight before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch \\ncomes up behind Peeta and me and growls, \\n\"Remember, you\\'re still a happy pair. So act like it.\" \\n\\nWhat? I thought we abandoned that when Peeta \\nasked for separate coaching. But I guess that was a \\nprivate, not a public thing. Anyway, there\\'s not much \\nchance for interaction now, as we walk single-file to \\nour seats and take our places. \\n\\nJust stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid \\nand shallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my \\ntemples. It\\'s a relief to get to my chair, because \\nbetween the heels and my legs shaking, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll \\ntrip. Although evening is falling, the City Circle is \\nbrighter than a summer\\'s day. An elevated seating \\nunit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the \\nstylists commanding the front row. The cameras will \\nturn to them when the crowd is reacting to their \\nhandiwork. A large balcony off a building to the right \\nhas been reserved for the Gamemakers. Television \\ncrews have claimed most of the other balconies. But \\n\\n\\n\\n118 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are \\ncompletely packed with people. Standing room only. \\nAt homes and community halls around the country, \\nevery television set is turned on. Every citizen of \\nPanem is tuned in. There will be no blackouts tonight. \\n\\nCaesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the \\ninterviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the \\nstage. It\\'s a little scary because his appearance has \\nbeen virtually unchanged during all that time. Same \\nface under a coating of pure white makeup. Same \\nhairstyle that he dyes a different color for each \\nHunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue \\ndotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that \\ntwinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to \\nmake people appear younger and thinner. In District \\n12, looking old is something of an achievement since \\nso many people die early. You see an elderly person \\nyou want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask \\nthe secret of survival. A plump person is envied \\nbecause they aren\\'t scraping by like the majority of \\nus. But here it is different. Wrinkles aren\\'t desirable. \\nA round belly isn\\'t a sign of success. \\n\\nThis year, Caesar\\'s hair is powder blue and his \\neyelids and lips are coated in the same hue. He looks \\nfreakish but less frightening than he did last year \\nwhen his color was crimson and he seemed to be \\nbleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the \\naudience but then gets down to business. \\n\\nThe girl tribute from District 1 , looking provocative in \\na see-through gold gown, steps up the center of the \\nstage to join Caesar for her interview. You can tell her \\nmentor didn\\'t have any trouble coming up with an \\nangle for her. With that flowing blonde hair, emerald \\ngreen eyes, her body tall and lush ... she\\'s sexy all the \\nway. \\n\\n\\n\\n119 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nEach interview only lasts three minutes. Then a \\nbuzzer goes off and the next tribute is up. Ill say this \\nfor Caesar, he really does his best to make the \\ntributes shine. He\\'s friendly, tries to set the nervous \\nones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and can turn a \\nweak response into a memorable one by the way he \\nreacts. \\n\\nI sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the \\ndistricts slip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing \\nup some angle. The monstrous boy from District 2 is \\na ruthless killing machine. The fox-faced girl from \\nDistrict 5 sly and elusive. I spotted Cinna as soon as \\nhe took his place, but even his presence cannot relax \\nme. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very quiet. \\nMy palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled \\ndress isn\\'t absorbent and they skid right of if I try to \\ndry them. 1 1 . \\n\\nRue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete \\nwith wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls \\nover the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a \\ntribute. Caesar\\'s very sweet with her, complimenting \\nher seven in training, an excellent score for one so \\nsmall. When he asks her what her greatest strength \\nin the arena will be, she doesn\\'t hesitate. \"I\\'m very \\nhard to catch, \"she says in a tremulous voice. \"And if \\nthey can\\'t catch me, they can\\'t kill me. So don\\'t count \\nme out.\" \\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t in a million years,\" says Caesar \\nencouragingly. \\n\\nThe boy tribute from District 1 1 , Thresh, has the \\nsame dark skin as Rue, but the resemblance stops \\nthere. He\\'s one of the giants, probably six and a half \\nfeet tall and built like an ox, but I noticed he rejected \\nthe invitations from the Career Tributes to join their \\ncrowd. Instead he\\'s been very solitary, speaking to no \\n\\n120 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\none, showing little interest in training. Even so, he \\nscored a ten and it\\'s not hard to imagine he \\nimpressed the Gamemakers. He ignores Caesar\\'s \\nattempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or \\njust remains silent. \\n\\nIf only I was his size, I could get away with sullen and \\nhostile and it would be just fine! I bet half the \\nsponsors are at least considering him. If I had any \\nmoney, I\\'d bet on him myself. \\n\\nAnd then they\\'re calling Katniss Everdeen, and I feel \\nmyself, as if in a dream, standing and making my way \\ncenter stage. I shake Caesar\\'s outstretched hand, and \\nhe has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off \\non his suit. \\n\\n\"So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from \\nDistrict Twelve. What\\'s impressed you most since you \\narrived here?\"asks Caesar. \\n\\nWhat? What did he say? It\\'s as if the words make no \\nsense. \\n\\nMy mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately \\nfind Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. I \\nimagine the words coming from his lips. \"What\\'s \\nimpressed you most since you arrived here?\" I rack \\nmy brain for something that made me happy here. Be \\nhonest, I think. Be honest. \\n\\n\"The lamb stew,\" I get out. \\n\\nCaesar laughs, and vaguely I realize some of the \\naudience has joined in. \\n\\n\"The one with the dried plums?\" asks Caesar. I nod. \\n\"Oh, I eat it by the bucketful.\" He turns sideways to \\nthe audience in horror, hand on his stomach. \"It \\n\\n\\n\\n121 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndoesn\\'t show, does it?\" They shout reassurances to \\nhim and applaud. This is what I mean about Caesar. \\nHe tries to help you out. \\n\\n\"Now, Katniss,\" he says confidentially, \"When you \\ncame out in the opening ceremonies, my heart \\nactually stopped. What did you think of that \\ncostume?\" \\n\\nCinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. \"You \\nmean after I got over my fear of being burned alive?\" I \\nask. \\n\\nBig laugh. A real one from the audience. \\n\"Yes. Start then,\" says Caesar. \\n\\nCinna, my friend, I should tellhimanyway.\"I thought \\nCinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous \\ncostume I\\'d ever seen and I couldn\\'t believe I was \\nwearing it. I can\\'t believe I\\'m wearing this, either.\" I \\nlift up my skirt to spread it out. \"I mean, look at it!\" \\n\\nAs the audience oohs and ahs, I see Cinna make the \\ntiniest circular motion with his finger. But I know \\nwhat he\\'s saying. Twirl for me. \\n\\nI spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate. \\n\\n\"Oh, do that again!\" says Caesar, and so I lift up my \\narms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly \\nout, letting the dress engulf me in flames. The \\naudience breaks into cheers. When I stop, I clutch \\nCaesar\\'s arm. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t stop!\" he says. \\n\\n\\n\\n122 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have to, I\\'m dizzy!\" I\\'m also giggling, which I think \\nI\\'ve done maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves \\nand the spinning have gotten to me. \\n\\nCaesar wraps a protective arm around me. \"Don\\'t \\nworry, I\\'ve got you. Can\\'t have you following in your \\nmentor\\'s footsteps.\" \\n\\nEveryone\\'s hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, \\nwho is by now famous for his head dive at the \\nreaping, and he waves them away good-naturedly and \\npoints back to me. \\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" Caesar reassures the crowd. \"She\\'s safe \\nwith me. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. \\nGive us a hint what happened in there.\" \\n\\nI glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite \\nmy lip. \"Um ... all I can say, is I think it was a first.\" \\n\\nThe cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are \\nchuckling and nodding. \\n\\n\"You\\'re killing us,\" says Caesar as if in actual \\npain. \"Details. Details.\" \\n\\nI address the balcony. \"I\\'m not supposed to talk about \\nit, right?\" \\n\\nThe Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts \\nout,\"She\\'s not!\" \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" I say. \"Sorry. My lips are sealed.\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s go back then, to the moment they called your \\nsister\\'s name at the reaping,\" says Caesar. His mood \\nis quieter now. \"And you volunteered. Can you tell us \\nabout her?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n123 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nNo. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. I don\\'t think \\nI\\'m imagining the sadness on his face. \"Her name\\'s \\nPrim. She\\'s just twelve. And I love her more than \\nanything.\" \\n\\nYou could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now. \\n\\n\"What did she say to you? After the reaping?\" Caesar \\nasks. \\n\\nBe honest. Be honest. I swallow hard. \"She asked me \\nto try really hard to win.\" The audience is frozen, \\nhanging on my every word. \\n\\n\"And what did you say?\" prompts Caesar gently. \\n\\nBut instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over \\nmy body. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. \\nWhen I speak, my voice seems to have dropped an \\noctave. \"I swore I would.\" \\n\\n\"I bet you did,\" says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The \\nbuzzer goes off. \"Sorry we\\'re out of time. Best of luck, \\nKatniss Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve.\" \\n\\nThe applause continues long after I\\'m seated. I look to \\nCinna for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs- \\nup. \\n\\nI\\'m still in a daze for the first part of Peeta\\'s interview. \\nHe has the audience from the get-go, though; I can \\nhear them laughing, shouting out. He plays up the \\nbaker\\'s son thing, comparing the tributes to the \\nbreads from their districts. Then has a funny \\nanecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers. \"Tell \\nme, do I still smell like roses?\" he asks Caesar, and \\nthen there\\'s a whole run where they take turns \\nsniffing each other that brings down the house. I\\'m \\n\\n\\n\\n124 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncoming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he \\nhas a girlfriend back home. \\n\\nPeeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of \\nhis head. \\n\\n\"Handsome lad like you. There must be some special \\ngirl. Come on, what\\'s her name?\" says Caesar. \\n\\nPeeta sighs. \"Well, there is this one girl. I\\'ve had a \\ncrush on her ever since I can remember. But I\\'m \\npretty sure she didn\\'t know I was alive until the \\nreaping.\" \\n\\nSounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love \\nthey can relate to. \\n\\n\"She have another fellow?\" asks Caesar. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, but a lot of boys like her,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"So, here\\'s what you do. You win, you go home. She \\ncan\\'t turn you down then, eh?\" says Caesar \\nencouragingly. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to work out. Winning... won\\'t \\nhelp in my case,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Why ever not?\" says Caesar, mystified. \\n\\nPeeta blushes beet red and stammersout. \"Because... \\nbecause... she came here with me.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n125 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPARTI \\n\"THE GAMES\" \\n\\n\\n\\n126 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment, the cameras hold on Peeta\\'s downcast \\neyes as what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, \\nmouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest, \\nmagnified on every screen as I realize, Me! He means \\nme! I press my lips together and stare at the floor, \\nhoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil \\nup inside of me. \\n\\n\"Oh, that is a piece of bad luck,\" says Caesar, and \\nthere\\'s a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is \\nmurmuring in agreement, a few have even given \\nagonized cries. \\n\\n\"It\\'s not good,\" agrees Peeta. \\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t think any of us can blame you. It\\'d be \\nhard not to fall for that young lady,\" says Caesar. \\n\"She didn\\'t know?\" \\n\\nPeeta shakes his head. \"Not until now.\" \\n\\nI allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long \\nenough to see that the blush on my cheeks is \\nunmistakable. \\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you love to pull her back out here and get a \\nresponse?\" Caesar asks the audience. The crowd \\nscreams assent. \"Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss \\nEverdeen\\'s time has been spent. Well, best of luck to \\nyou, Peeta Mellark, and I think I speak for all of \\nPanem when I say our hearts go with yours.\" \\n\\nThe roar of the crowdis deafening. Peeta has \\nabsolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his \\n\\n\\n\\n127 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndeclaration of love for me. When the audience finally \\nsettles down, he chokes out a quiet \"Thank you\" and \\nreturns to his seat. We stand for the anthem. I have \\nto raise my head out of the required respect and \\ncannot avoid seeing that every screen is now \\ndominated by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a \\nfew feet that in the viewers \\'heads can never be \\nbreached. Poor tragic us. \\n\\nBut I know better. \\n\\nAfter the anthem, the tributes file back into the \\nTraining Center lobby and onto the elevators. I make \\nsure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. \\nThe crowd slows our entourages of stylists and \\nmentors and chaperones, so we have only each other \\nfor company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to \\ndeposit four tributes before I am alone and then find \\nthe doors opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only \\njust stepped from his car when I slam my palms into \\nhis chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an \\nugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and \\nshatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in \\nthe shards, and blood immediately flows from his \\nhands. \\n\\n\"What was that for?\" he says, aghast. \\n\\n\"You had no right! No right to go saying those things \\nabout me!\" I shout at him. \\n\\nNow the elevators open and the whole crew is there, \\nEffie, Haymitch, Cinna, and Portia. \\n\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" says Effie, a note of hysteria in her \\nvoice. \"Did you fall?\" \\n\\n\"After she shoved me,\" says Peeta asEffie and Cinna \\nhelp him up. \\n\\n\\n\\n128 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch turns on me. \"Shoved him?\" \\n\\n\"This was your idea, wasn\\'t it? Turning me into some \\nkind of fool in front of the entire country?\" I answer. \\n\\n\"It was my idea,\" says Peeta, wincing as he pulls \\nspikes of pottery from his palms. \"Haymitch just \\nhelped me with it.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you!\" I say. \\n\\n\"You are a fool,\" Haymitch says in disgust. \"Do you \\nthink he hurt you? That boy just gave you something \\nyou could never achieve on your own.\" \\n\\n\"He made me look weak!\" I say. \\n\\n\"He made you look desirable! And let\\'s face it, you can \\nuse all the help you can get in that department. You \\nwere about as romantic as dirt until he said he \\nwanted you. Now they all do. You\\'re all they\\'re talking \\nabout. The star-crossed lovers from District Twelve!\" \\nsays Haymitch. \\n\\n\"But we\\'re not star-crossed lovers!\" I say. \\n\\nHaymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against \\nthe wall. \"Who cares? It\\'s all a big show. It\\'s all how \\nyou\\'re perceived. The most I could say about you after \\nyour interview was that you were nice enough, \\nalthough that in itself was a small miracle. Now I can \\nsay you\\'re a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the boys \\nback home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you \\nthink will get you more sponsors?\" \\n\\nThe smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. I \\nshove his hands off my shoulders and step away, \\ntrying to clear my head. \\n\\n\\n\\n129 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nCinna comes over and puts his arm around me. \"He\\'s \\nright, Katniss.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t know what to think. \"I should have been told, \\nso I didn\\'t look so stupid.\" \\n\\n\"No, your reaction was perfect. If you\\'d known, it \\nwouldn\\'t have read as real,\" says Portia. \\n\\n\"She\\'s just worried about her boyfriend,\" says Peeta \\ngruffly, tossing away a bloody piece of the urn. \\n\\nMy cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. \"I don\\'t \\nhave a boyfriend.\" \\n\\n\"Whatever,\" says Peeta. \"But I bet he\\'s smart enough \\nto know a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didn\\'t \\nsay you loved me. So what does it matter?\" \\n\\nThe words are sinking in. My anger fading. I\\'m torn \\nnow between thinking I\\'ve been used and thinking I\\'ve \\nbeen given an edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my \\ninterview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning \\nin a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The only moment of \\nany substance I hail was when I talked about Prim. \\nCompare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, \\nand I\\'m forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. \\nNo, not entirely forgettable, I have my eleven in \\ntraining. \\n\\nBut now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not \\njust his. To hear him tell it I have many admirers. \\nAnd iftheaudience really thinks we\\'re in love ... I \\nremember howstrongly they responded to his \\nconfession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is right, \\nthey eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly I\\'m \\nworried that I didn\\'t react properly. \\n\\n\\n\\n130 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"After he said he loved me, did you thinkl could be in \\nlove with him, too?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"I did,\" says Portia. \"The way you avoidedlooking at \\nthe cameras, the blush.\" \\n\\nThey others chime in, agreeing. \\n\\n\"You\\'re golden, sweetheart. You\\'re going to have \\nsponsors lined up around the block,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nI\\'m embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to \\nacknowledge Peeta. \"I\\'m sorry I shoved you.\" \\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t matter,\" he shrugs. \"Although it\\'s technically \\nillegal.\" \\n\\n\"Are your hands okay?\" I ask. \"TheyH be all right,\" he \\nsays. \\n\\nIn the silence that follows, delicious smells of our \\ndinner waft in from the dining room. \"Come on, let\\'s \\neat,\" says Haymitch. We all follow him to the table \\nand take our places. But then Peeta is bleeding too \\nheavily, and Portia leads him off for medical \\ntreatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup \\nwithout them. By the time we\\'ve finished, they\\'re \\nback. Peeta\\'s hands are wrapped in bandages. I can\\'t \\nhelp feeling guilty. Tomorrow we will be in the arena. \\nHe has done me a favor and I have answered with an \\ninjury. Will I never stop owing him? \\n\\nAfter dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. \\nI seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my \\ndress, although the others assure me I am charming. \\nPeeta actually is charming and then utterly winning \\nas the boy in love.Andthere I am, blushing and \\nconfused, madebeautiful by Cinna\\'s hands, desirable \\n\\n\\n\\n131 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nby Peeta\\'s confession, tragic by circumstance, and by \\nall accounts, unforgettable. \\n\\nWhen the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, \\na hush falls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will \\nbe roused and prepared for the arena. The actual \\nGames don\\'t start until ten because so many of the \\nCapitol residents rise late. But Peeta and I must make \\nan early start. There is no telling how far we will \\ntravel to the arena that has been prepared for this \\nyear\\'s Games. \\n\\nI know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. \\nAs soon as they leave here, they\\'ll be at the Games \\nHeadquarters, hopefully madly signing up our \\nsponsors, working out a strategy on how and when to \\ndeliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Portia will travel \\nwith us to the very spot from which we will be \\nlaunched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be \\nsaid here. \\n\\nEffie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual \\ntears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being \\nthe best tributes it has ever been her privilege to \\nsponsor. And then, because it\\'s Effie and she\\'s \\napparently required by law to say something awful, \\nshe adds \"I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if I finally get \\npromoted to a decent district next year!\" \\n\\nThen she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries \\nout, overcome with either the emotional parting or the \\npossible improvement of her fortunes. \\n\\nHaymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over. \\n\\n\"Any final words of advice?\" asks Peeta. \\n\\n\"When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. \\nYou\\'re neither of you up to the blood bath at the \\n\\n\\n\\n132 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nCornucopia. Just clear out, put as much distance as \\nyou can between yourselves and the others, and find \\na source of water,\" he says. \"Got it?\" \\n\\n\"And after that?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Stay alive,\" says Haymitch. It\\'s the same advice he \\ngave us on the train, but he\\'s not drunk and laughing \\nthis time. And we only nod. What else is there to say? \\n\\nWhen I head to my room, Peeta lingers to talk to \\nPortia. I\\'m glad. Whatever strange words of parting we \\nexchange can wait until tomorrow. My covers are \\ndrawn back, but there is no sign of the redheaded \\nAvox girl. I wish I knew her name. I should have \\nasked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it out. \\nBut perhaps that would only result in punishment for \\nher. \\n\\nI take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the \\nmakeup, the scent of beauty from my body. All that \\nremains of the design-team\\'s efforts are the flames on \\nmy nails. I decide to keep them as reminder of who I \\nam to the audience. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. \\nPerhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the \\ndays to come. \\n\\nI pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. \\nIt takes me about five seconds to realize I\\'ll never fall \\nasleep. And I need sleep desperately because in the \\narena every moment I give in to fatigue will be an \\ninvitation to death. \\n\\nIt\\'s no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my \\neyelids refuse to get heavy. I can\\'t stop trying to \\nimagine exactly what terrain I\\'ll be thrown into. \\nDesert? Swamp? A frigid wasteland? Above all I am \\nhoping for trees, which may afford me some means of \\nconcealment and food and shelter, Often there are \\n\\n\\n\\n133 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ntrees because barren landscapes are dull and the \\nGames resolve too quickly without them. But what \\nwill the climate be like? What traps have the \\nGamemakers hid den to liven up the slower \\nmoments? And then there are my fellow tributes . . . \\n\\nThe more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it \\neludes me. Finally, I am too restless to even stay in \\nbed. I pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing \\ntoo short. My room feels like a prison cell. If I don\\'t \\nget air soon, I\\'m going to start to throw things again. I \\nrun down the hall to the door to the roof. It\\'s not only \\nunlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, \\nbut it doesn\\'t matter. The energy field enclosing the \\nroof prevents any desperate form of escape. And I\\'m \\nnot looking to escape, only to fill my lungs with air. I \\nwant to see the sky and the moon on the last night \\nthat no one will be hunting me. \\n\\nThe roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel \\nreach its tiled surface I see his silhouette, black \\nagainst the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol. \\nThere\\'s quite a commotion going on down in the \\nstreets, music and singing and car horns, none of \\nwhich I could hear through the thick glass window \\npanels in my room. I could slip away now, without \\nhim noticing me; he wouldn\\'t hear me over the din, \\nBut the night air\\'s so sweet, I can\\'t bear returning to \\nthat stuffy cage of a room. And what difference does it \\nmake? Whether we speak or not? \\n\\nMy feet move soundlessly across the tiles. I\\'m only \\nyard behind him when I say, \"You should be getting \\nsome sleep.\" \\n\\nHe starts but doesn\\'t turn. I can see him give his \\nhead a slight shake. \"I didn\\'t want to miss the party. \\nIt\\'s for us, after all.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n134 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI come up beside him and lean over the edge of the \\nrail. The wide streets are full of dancing people. I \\nsquint to make out their tiny figures in more detail. \\n\"Are they in costumes?\" \\n\\n\"Who could tell?\" Peeta answers. \"With all the crazy \\nclothes they wear here. Couldn\\'t sleep, either?\" \\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t turn my mind off,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Thinking about your family?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"No,\" I admit a bit guiltily. \"All I can do is wonder \\nabout tomorrow. Which is pointless, of course.\" In the \\nlight from below, I can see his face now, the awkward \\nway he holds his bandaged hands. \"I really am sorry \\nabout your hands.\" \\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter, Katniss,\" he says. \"I\\'ve never been \\na contender in these Games anyway.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s no way to be thinking,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Why not? It\\'s true. My best hope is to not disgrace \\nmyself and ...\" He hesitates. \\n\\n\"And what?\" I say. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to say it exactly. Only ... I want to \\ndie as myself. Does that make any sense?\" he asks. I \\nshake my head. How could he die as anyone but \\nhimself? \"I don\\'t want them to change me in there. \\nTurn me into some kind of monster that I\\'m not.\" \\n\\nI bite my lip feeling inferior. While I\\'ve been \\nruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been \\nstruggling with how to maintain his identity. His \\npurity of self. \"Do you mean you won\\'t kill anyone?\" I \\nask. \\n\\n\\n\\n135 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, when the time comes, I\\'m sure I\\'ll kill just like \\neverybody else. I can\\'t go down without a fight. Only I \\nkeep wishing I could think of a way to ... to show the \\nCapitol they don\\'t own me. That I\\'m more than just a \\npiece in their Games,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"But you\\'re not,\" I say. \"None of us are. That\\'s how \\nthe Games work.\" \\n\\n\"Okay, but within that framework, there\\'s still you, \\nthere\\'s still me,\" he insists. \"Don\\'t you see?\" \\n\\n\"A little. Only ... no offense, but who cares, Peeta?\"I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"I do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at \\nthis point?\" he asks angrily. He\\'s locked those blue \\neyes on mine now, demanding an answer. \\n\\nI take a step back. \"Care about what Haymitch said. \\nAbout staying alive.\" \\n\\nPeeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. \"Okay. Thanks \\nfor the tip, sweetheart.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch\\'s \\npatronizing endearment. \"Look, if you want to spend \\nthe last hours of your life planning some noble death \\nin the arena, that\\'s your choice. I want to spend mine \\nin District Twelve.\" \\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t surprise me if you do,\" says Peeta. \"Give \\nmy mother my best when you make it back, will you?\" \\n\\n\"Count on it,\" I say. Then I turn and leave the roof. I \\nspend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a \\ndoze, imagining the cutting remarks I will make to \\nPeeta Mellark in the morning. Peeta Mellark. We will \\nsee how high and mighty he is when he\\'s faced with \\n\\n\\n\\n136 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nlife and death. He\\'ll probably turn into one of those \\nraging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat \\nsomeone\\'s heart after they\\'ve killed them. There was a \\nguy like that a few years ago from District 6 called \\nTitus. He went completely savage and the \\nGamemakers had to have him stunned with electric \\nguns to collect the bodies of the players he\\'d killed \\nbefore he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, \\nbut cannibalism doesn\\'t play well with the Capitol \\naudience, so they tried to head it off. There was some \\nspeculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus \\nout was specifically engineered to ensure the victor \\nwas not a lunatic. \\n\\nI don\\'t see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me \\nbefore dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and \\nguides me to the roof. My final dressing and \\npreparations will be alone in the catacombs under the \\narena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just \\nlike the one did in the woods the day I saw the \\nredheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops \\ndown. I place my hands and feet on the lower rungs \\nand instantly it\\'s as if I\\'m frozen. Some sort of current \\nglues me to the ladder while I\\'m lifted safely inside. \\n\\nI expect the ladder to release me then, but I\\'m still \\nstuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me \\ncarrying a syringe. \"This is just your tracker, Katniss. \\nThe stiller you are, the more efficiently I can place it,\" \\nshe says. \\n\\nStill? I\\'m a statue. But that doesn\\'t prevent me from \\nfeeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts \\nthe metal tracking device deep under the skin on the \\ninside of my forearm. Now the Gamemakers will \\nalways be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena. \\nWouldn\\'t want to lose a tribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n137 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the tracker\\'s in place, the ladder releases \\nme. The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved \\nfrom the roof, An Avox boy comes in and directs us to \\na room where breakfast has been laid out. Despite the \\ntension in my stomach,Ieat as much as I can, \\nalthough none of the delectable food makes any \\nimpression on me. I\\'m so nervous, I could be eating \\ncoal dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the \\nview from the windows as we sail over the city and \\nthen to the wilderness beyond. This is what birds see. \\nOnly they\\'re free and safe. The very opposite of me. \\n\\nThe ride lasts about half an hour before the windows \\nblack out, suggesting that we\\'re nearing the arena. \\nThe hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go back to the \\nladder, only this time it leads down into a tube \\nunderground, into the catacombs that lie beneath the \\narena. We follow instructions to my destination, a \\nchamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call \\nit the Launch Room. In the districts, it\\'s referred to as \\nthe Stockyard. The place animals go before slaughter. \\n\\nEverything is brand-new, I will be the first and only \\ntribute to use this Launch Room. The arenas are \\nhistoric sites, preserved after the Games. Popular \\ndestinations for Capitol residents to visit, to vacation. \\nGo for a month, rewatch the Games, tour the \\ncatacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took \\nplace. You can even take part in reenactments. They \\nsay the food is excellent. \\n\\nI struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and \\nclean my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple \\ntrademark braid down my back. Then the clothes \\narrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no \\nsay in my outfit, does not even know what will be in \\nthe package, but he helps me dress in the \\nundergarments, simple tawny pants, light green \\nblouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin, hooded black \\n138 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\njacket that falls to my thighs. \"The material in the \\njacket\\'s designed to reflect body heat. Expect some \\ncool nights, \"he says. \\n\\nThe boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than I \\ncould have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones \\nat home. These have a narrow flexible rubber sole \\nwith treads though. Good for running. \\n\\nI think I\\'m finished when Cinna pulls the gold \\nmockingj ay pin from his pocket. I had completely \\nforgotten about it. \\n\\n\"Where did you get that?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Off the green outfit you wore on the train,\" he says. I \\nremember now taking it off my mother\\'s dress, \\npinning it to the shirt. \"It\\'s your district token, right?\" \\nI nod and he fastens it on my shirt. \"It barely cleared \\nthe review board. Some thought the pin could be used \\nas a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage. But \\neventually, they let it through,\" says Cinna. \"They \\neliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. \\nIf you twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. \\nPoisoned one. She claimed she had no knowledge the \\nring transformed and there was no way to prove she \\ndid. But she lost her token. There, you\\'re all set. Move \\naround. Make sure everything feels comfortable.\" \\n\\nI walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. \"Yes, it\\'s \\nfine. Fits perfectly.\" \\n\\n\"Then there\\'s nothing to do but wait for the call,\" says \\nCinna. \"Unless you think you could eat any more?\" \\n\\nI turn down food but accept a glass of water that I \\ntake tiny sips of as we wait on a couch. I don\\'t want \\nto chew on my nails or lips, so I find myself gnawing \\non the inside of my cheek. It still hasn\\'t fully healed \\n\\n\\n\\n139 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom a few days ago. Soon the taste of blood fills my \\nmouth. \\n\\nNervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is \\nto come. I could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. \\nNot even. My fingers obsessively trace the hard little \\nlump on my forearm where the woman injected the \\ntracking device. I press on it, even though it hurts, I \\npress on it so hard a small bruise begins to form. \\n\\n\"Do you want to talk, Katniss?\" Cinna asks. \\n\\nI shake my head but after a moment hold out my \\nhand to him. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And \\nthis is how we sit until a pleasant female voice \\nannounces it\\'s time to prepare for launch. \\n\\nStill clenching one of Cinna\\'s hands, I walk over and \\nstand on the circular metal plate. \"Remember what \\nHaymitch said. Run, find water. The rest will follow,\" \\nhe says. I nod. \"And remember this. I\\'m not allowed to \\nbet, but if I could, my money would be on you.\" \\n\\n\"Truly?\" I whisper. \\n\\n\"Truly,\" says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on \\nthe forehead. \"Good luck, girl on fire.\" And then a \\nglass cylinder is lowering around me, breaking our \\nhandhold, cutting him off from me. He taps his \\nfingers under his chin. Head high. \\n\\nI lift my chin and stand as straight as I can. The \\ncylinder begins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, I\\'m \\nin darkness and then I can feel the metal plate \\npushing me out of the cylinder, into the open air. For \\na moment, my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight \\nand I\\'m conscious only of a strong wind with the \\nhopeful smell of pine trees. \\n\\n\\n\\n140 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThen I hear the legendary announcer, Claudius \\nTemplesmith, as his voice booms all around me. \\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger \\nGames begin!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n141 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nSixty seconds. That\\'s how long we\\'re required to stand \\non our metal circles before the sound of a gong \\nreleases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land \\nmines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the \\nring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a \\ngiant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved \\ntail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, \\nspilling over with the things that will give us life here \\nin the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, \\nmedicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the \\nCornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing \\nthe farther they are from the horn. For instance, only \\na few steps from my feet lays a three-foot square of \\nplastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a \\ndownpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent \\npack that would protect from almost any sort of \\nweather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it \\nagainst the other twenty- three tributes. Which I have \\nbeen instructed not to do. \\n\\nWe\\'re on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of \\nhard-packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, \\nI can see nothing, indicating either a steep downward \\nslope or even cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left \\nand back, spars piney woods. This is where Haymitch \\nwould want me to go. Immediately. \\n\\nI hear his instructions in my head. \"Just clear out, \\nput as much distance as you can between yourselves \\nand the others, and find a source of water.\" \\n\\nBut it\\'s tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty \\nwaiting there before me. And I know that if I don\\'t get \\nit, someone else will. That the Career Tributes who \\n\\n\\n\\n142 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsurvive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life- \\nsustaining spoils. Something catches my eye. There, \\nresting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath \\nof arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to \\nbe engaged. That\\'s mine, I think.It\\'s meant for me. \\n\\nI\\'m fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our \\nschool although a couple can beat me in distance \\nraces. But this forty -yard length, this is what I am \\nbuilt for. I know I can get it, I know I can reach it \\nfirst, but then the question is how quickly can I get \\nout of there? By the time I\\'ve scrambled up the packs \\nand grabbed the weapons, others will have reached \\nthe horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, \\nbut say there\\'s a dozen, at that close range, they \\ncould take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or \\ntheir own powerful fists. \\n\\nStill, I won\\'t be the only target. I\\'m betting many of \\nthe other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even \\none who scored an eleven in training, to take out their \\nmore fierce adversaries. \\n\\nHaymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had \\nhe\\'d tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that\\'s \\nthe very weapon that might be my salvation. And I \\nonly see one bow in that whole pile. I know the \\nminute must be almost up and will have to decide \\nwhat my strategy will be and I find myself positioning \\nmy feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests \\nbut toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I \\nnotice Peeta, he\\'s about five tributes to my right, quite \\na fair distance, still I can tell he\\'s looking at me and I \\nthink he might be shaking his head. But the sun\\'s in \\nmy eyes, and while I\\'m puzzling over it the gong rings \\nout. \\n\\nAnd I\\'ve missed it! I\\'ve missed my chance! Because \\nthose extra couple of seconds I\\'ve lost by not being \\n143 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nready are enough to change my mind about going in. \\nMy feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the \\ndirection my brain wants to take and then I lunge \\nforward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of \\nbread. The pickings are so small and I\\'m so angry \\nwith Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty \\nyards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could \\nhold anything because I can\\'t stand leaving with \\nvirtually nothing. \\n\\nA boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the \\nsame time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it \\nand then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I \\nstagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. \\nThen the boy slips to the ground. That\\'s when I see \\nthe knife in his back. Already other tributes have \\nreached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to \\nattack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, \\nrunning toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen \\nknives. I\\'ve seen her throw in training. She never \\nmisses. And I\\'m her next target. \\n\\nAll the general fear I\\'ve been feeling condenses into at \\nimmediate fear of this girl, this predator who might \\nkill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and \\nI sling the pack over one shoulder and run full- speed \\nfor the woods. I can hear the blade whistling toward \\nme and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my \\nhead. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on \\nmy shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I \\nknow the girl will not pursue me. That she\\'ll be drawn \\nback into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is \\ngone. A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I \\nthink. \\n\\nAt the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to \\nsurvey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are \\nhacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie \\ndead already on the ground. Those who have taken \\n144 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nflight are disappearing into the trees or into the void \\nopposite me. I continue running until the woods have \\nhidden me from the other tributes then slow into a \\nsteady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For \\nthe next few hours, I alternate between jogging and \\nwalking, putting as much distance as I can between \\nmyself and my competitors. I lost my bread during \\nthe struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed \\nto stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it \\nneatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated \\nnear the handle, which will make it handy for sawing \\nthrough things \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and slide it into my belt. I don\\'t \\ndare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I \\njust keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers. \\n\\nI can go a long time. I know that from my days in the \\nwoods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch\\'s \\nsecond instruction, and since I sort of botched the \\nfirst, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck. \\n\\nThe woods begin to evolve, and the pines are \\nintermixed with a variety of trees, some I recognize, \\nsome completely foreign to me. At one point, I hear a \\nnoise and pull my knife, thinking I may have to \\ndefend myself, but I\\'ve only startled a rabbit. \"Good to \\nsee you,\" I whisper. If there\\'s one rabbit, there could \\nbe hundreds just waiting to be snared. \\n\\nThe ground slopes down. I don\\'t particularly like this. \\nValleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like \\nin the hills around District 12, where I can see my \\nenemies approaching. But I have no choice but to \\nkeep going. \\n\\nFunny though, I don\\'t feel too bad. The days of \\ngorging myself have paid off. I\\'ve got staying power \\neven though I\\'m short on sleep. Being in the woods is \\nrejuvenating. I\\'m glad for the solitude, even though \\n145 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nit\\'s an illusion, because I\\'m probably on-screen right \\nnow. Not consistently but off and on. There are so \\nmany deaths to show the first day that a tribute \\ntrekking through the woods isn\\'t much to look at. But \\nthey 11 show me enough to let people know I\\'m alive, \\nuninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days \\nof betting is the opening, when the initial casualties \\ncome in. But that can\\'t compare to what happens as \\nthe field shrinks to a handful of players. \\n\\nIt\\'s late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. \\nEach shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting \\nmust have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They \\nnever collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers \\nhave dispersed. On the opening day, they don\\'t even \\nfire the cannons until the initial fighting\\'s over \\nbecause it\\'s too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I \\nallow myself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. \\nOne . . . two . . . three ... on and on until they reach \\neleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My \\nfingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from \\nDistrict 9 coughed into my face. He\\'s gone, certainly. I \\nwonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? \\nI\\'ll know in a few hours. When they project the dead\\'s \\nimages into the sky for the rest of us to see. \\n\\nAll of a sudden, I\\'m overwhelmed by the thought that \\nPeeta may be already lost, bled white, collected, and \\nin the process of being transported back to the \\nCapitol to be cleaned up, redressed, and shipped in a \\nsimple wooden box back to District 12. No longer \\nhere. Heading home. I try hard to remember if I saw \\nhim once the action started. But the last image I can \\nconjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang \\nout. \\n\\nMaybe it\\'s better, if he\\'s gone already. He had no \\nconfidence he could win. And I will not end up with \\n\\n\\n\\n146 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe it\\'s better if \\nhe\\'s out of this for good. \\n\\nI slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to \\ngo through it anyway before night falls. See what I \\nhave to work with. As I unhook the straps, I can feel \\nit\\'s sturdily made although a rather unfortunate \\ncolor. This orange will practically glow in the dark. I \\nmake a mental note to camouflage it first thing \\ntomorrow. \\n\\nI flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this \\nmoment, is water. Haymitch\\'s directive to immediately \\nfind water was not arbitrary. I won\\'t last long without \\nit. For a few days, 111 be able to function with \\nunpleasant symptomsof dehydration, but after that \\nI\\'ll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a \\nweek, tops. I carefully lay out the provisions. One thin \\nblack sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of \\ncrackers. A pack of dried beef strips. A bottle of \\niodine. A box of wooden matches. A small coil of wire. \\nA pair of sunglasses. And a half-gallon plastic bottle \\nwith a cap for carrying water that\\'s bone dry. \\n\\nNo water. How hard would it have been for them to fill \\nup the bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my \\nthroat and mouth, the cracks in my lips. I\\'ve been \\nmoving all day long. It\\'s been hot and I\\'ve sweat a lot. \\nI do this at home, but there are always streams to \\ndrink from, or snow to melt if it should come to it. \\n\\nAs I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. \\nThe one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to \\nsound. What if that\\'s the only water source in the \\narena? That way they\\'ll guarantee drawing us in to \\nfight. The lake is a full day\\'s journey from where I sit \\nnow, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. \\nAnd then, even if I reach it, it\\'s sure to be heavily \\nguarded by some of the Career Tributes. I\\'m about to \\n147 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\npanic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier \\ntoday. It has to drink, too. I just have to find out \\nwhere. \\n\\nTwilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees \\nare too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of \\npine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes \\ntracking animals harder when I need their trails to \\nfind water. And I\\'m still heading downhill, deeper and \\ndeeper into a valley that seems endless. \\n\\nI\\'m hungry, too, but I don\\'t dare break into my \\nprecious store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take \\nmy knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away \\nthe outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the \\nsofter inner bark. I slowly chew the stuff as I walk \\nalong. After a week of the finest food in the world, it\\'s \\na little hard to choke down. But I\\'ve eaten plenty of \\npine in my life. Ill adjust quickly. \\n\\nIn another hour, it\\'s clear I\\'ve got to find a place to \\ncamp. Night creatures are coming out. I can hear the \\noccasional hoot or howl, my first clue that 111 be \\ncompeting with natural predators for the rabbits. As \\nto whether 111 be viewed as a source of food, it\\'s too \\nsoon to tell. There could be any number of animals \\nstalking me at this moment. \\n\\nBut right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a \\npriority. I\\'m sure many will continue hunting through \\nthe night. Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia \\nwill have food, an abundance of water from the lake, \\ntorches or flashlights, and weapons they\\'re itching to \\nuse. I can only hope I\\'ve traveled far and fast enough \\nto be out of range. \\n\\nBefore settling down, I take my wire and set two \\ntwitch-up snares in the brush. I know it\\'s risky to be \\nsetting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I \\n148 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncan\\'t set snares on the run. Still, I walk another five \\nminutes before making camp. \\n\\nI pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but \\nset in a clump of other willows, offering concealment \\nin those long, flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to \\nthe stronger branches close to the trunk, and find a \\nsturdy fork for my bed. It takes some doing, but I \\narrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable \\nmanner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, \\nthen slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my \\nbelt, loop it all the way around the branch and my \\nsleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if I roll \\nover in my sleep, I won\\'t go crashing to the ground. \\nI\\'m small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my \\nhead, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, the \\nair is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting \\nthe backpack, I know now it was the right choice. \\nThis sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my \\nbody heat, will be invaluable. I\\'m sure there are \\nseveral other tributes whose biggest concern right \\nnow is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be \\nable to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn\\'t so \\nthirsty ... \\n\\nNight has just come when I hear the anthem that \\nproceeds the death recap. Through the branches I can \\nsee the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be \\nfloating in the sky. I\\'m actually viewing another \\nscreen, an enormous one that\\'s transported by of one \\nof their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades \\nout and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we \\nwould be watching full coverage of each and every \\nkilling, but that\\'s thought to give an unfair advantage \\nto the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands \\non the bow and shot someone, my secret would be \\nrevealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are \\nthe same photographs they showed when they \\ntelevised our training scores. Simple head shots. But \\n149 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nnow instead of scores they post only district numbers. \\nI take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead \\ntributes begin and tick them off one by one on my \\nfingers. \\n\\nThe first to appear is the girl from District 3. That \\nmeans that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all \\nsurvived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I \\ndidn\\'t expect that one, usually all the Careers make it \\nthrough the first day. The boy from District 5 ... I \\nguess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 \\nand 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there\\'s the \\nboy who I fought for the backpack. I\\'ve run through \\nmy fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it \\nPeeta? No, there\\'s the girl from District 10. That\\'s it. \\nThe Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. \\nThen darkness and the sounds of the forest resume. \\n\\nI\\'m relieved Peeta\\'s alive. I tell myself again that if I \\nget killed, his winning will benefit my mother and \\nPrim the most. This is what I tell myself to explain the \\nconflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. \\nThe gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing \\nhis love for me in the interview. The anger at his \\nsuperiority on the roof. The dread that we may come \\nface-to-face at any moment in this arena. \\n\\nEleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work \\nout who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh \\nand Rue. Rue ... so she made it through the first day \\nafter all. I can\\'t help feeling glad. That makes ten of \\nus. The other three I\\'ll figure out tomorrow. Now when \\nit is dark, and I have traveled far, and I am nestled \\nhigh in this tree, now I must try and rest. \\n\\nI haven\\'t really slept in two days, and then there\\'s \\nbeen the long day\\'s journey into the arena. Slowly, I \\nallow my muscles to relax. My eyes to close. The last \\nthing I think is it\\'s lucky I don\\'t snore... . \\n150 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nSnap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. \\nHow long have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The \\ntip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! What\\'s going \\non? This is not the sound of a branch under \\nsomeone\\'s foot, but the sharp crack of one coming \\nfrom a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several \\nhundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn \\nmyself in that direction. For a few minutes, there\\'s \\nnothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then I see \\na spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of \\nhands warms over flames, but I can\\'t make out more \\nthan that. \\n\\nI have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I \\nknow at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A \\nfire 111 just at nightfall would have been one thing. \\nThose who battled at the Cornucopia, with their \\nsuperior strength and surplus of supplies, they \\ncouldn\\'t possibly have been near enough to spot the \\nflames then. But now, when they\\'ve probably been \\ncombing the woods for hours looking for victims. You \\nmight as well be waving a flag and shouting, \"Come \\nand get me!\" \\n\\nAnd here I am a stone\\'s throw from the biggest idiot \\nin the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee \\nsince my general location has just been broadcast to \\nany killer who cares. I mean, I know it\\'s cold out here \\nand not everybody has a sleeping bag. But then you \\ngrit your teeth and stick it out until dawn! \\n\\nI lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of \\nhours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I \\nwon\\'t have the least problem taking out my new \\nneighbor. My instinct has been to flee, not fight. But \\nobviously this person\\'s a hazard. Stupid people are \\ndangerous. And this one probably doesn\\'t have much \\nin the way of weapons while I\\'ve got this excellent \\nknife. \\n\\n\\n\\n151 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of \\ndawn approaching. I\\'m beginning to think we \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\nmeaning the person whose death I\\'m now devising \\nand me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we might actually have gone unnoticed. \\nThen I hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a \\nrun. The fire starter must have dozed off. They\\'re on \\nher before she can escape. I know it\\'s a girl now, I can \\ntell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. \\nThen there\\'s laughter and congratulations from \\nseveral voices. Someone cries out, \"Twelve down and \\neleven to go!\" which gets a round of appreciative \\nhoots. \\n\\nSo they\\'re fighting in a pack. I\\'m not really surprised. \\nOften alliances are formed in the early stages of the \\nGames. The strong band together to hunt down the \\nweak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin \\nto turn on one another. I don\\'t have to wonder too \\nhard who has made this alliance. It 11 be the \\nremaining Career Tributes from Districts 1,2, and 4. \\nTwo boys and three girls. The ones who lunched \\ntogether. \\n\\nFor a moment, I hear them checking the girl for \\nsupplies. I can tell by their comments they\\'ve found \\nnothing good. I wonder if the victim is Rue but \\nquickly dismiss the thought. She\\'s much too bright to \\nbe building a fire like that. \\n\\n\"Better clear out so they can get the body before it \\nstarts stinking.\" I\\'m almost certain that\\'s the brutish \\nboy from District 2. There are murmurs of assent and \\nthen, to my horror, I hear the pack heading toward \\nme. They do not know I\\'m here. How could they? And \\nI\\'m well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while \\nthe sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag will \\nturn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep \\nmoving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute. \\n\\n\\n\\n152 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nBut the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards \\nfrom my tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see \\nan arm here, a boot there, through the breaks in the \\nbranches. I turn to stone, not even daring to breathe. \\nHave they spotted me? No, not yet. I can tell from \\ntheir words their minds are elsewhere. \\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t we have heard a cannon by now?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'d say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in \\nimmediately.\" \\n\\n\"Unless she isn\\'t dead.\" \\n\\n\"She\\'s dead. I stuck her myself.\" \\n\\n\"Then where \\'s the cannon?\" \\n\\n\"Someone should go back. Make sure the job\\'s done.\" \\n\\n\"Yeah, we don\\'t want to have to track her down \\ntwice.\" \\n\\n\"I said she\\'s dead!\" \\n\\nAn argument breaks out until one tribute silences the \\nothers. \"We\\'re wasting time! Ill go finish her and let\\'s \\nmove on!\" \\n\\nI almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n153 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. \\nI\\'ve rolled sideways off the fork and I\\'m facing the \\nground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my \\nfeet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, \\nbraced against the trunk. There must have been some \\nrustling when I tipped sideways, but the Careers have \\nbeen too caught up in their own argument to catch it. \\n\\n\"Go on, then, Lover Boy,\" says the boy from District \\n2. \"See for yourself.\" \\n\\nI just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading \\nback to the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with \\nbruises, there\\'s a bloody bandage on one arm, and \\nfrom the sound of his gait he\\'s limping somewhat. I \\nremember him shaking him his head, telling me not \\nto go into the fight for the supplies, when all along, all \\nalong he\\'d planned to throw himself into the thick of \\nthings. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid \\nhim to do. \\n\\nOkay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies \\nwas tempting. But this . . . this other thing. This \\nteaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down \\nthe rest of us. No one from District 12 would think of \\ndoing such a thing! Career tributes are overly vicious, \\narrogant, better fed, but only because they\\'re the \\nCapitol\\'s lapdogs. \\n\\nUniversally, solidly hated by all but those from their \\nown districts. I can imagine the things they\\'re saying \\nabout him back home now. And Peeta had the gall to \\ntalk to me about disgrace? \\n\\n\\n\\n154 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nObviously, the noble boy on the rooftop was playing \\njust one more game with me. But this will be his last. \\nI will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his \\ndeath, if I don\\'t kill him first myself. \\n\\nThe Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear \\nshot, then use hushed voices. \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t we just kill him now and get it over with?\" \\n\\n\"Let him tag along. What\\'s the harm? And he\\'s handy \\nwith that knife.\" \\n\\nIs he? That\\'s news. What a lot of interesting things \\nI\\'m learning about my friend Peeta today. \\n\\n\"Besides, he\\'s our best chance of finding her.\" \\n\\nIt takes me a moment to register that the \"her\" they\\'re \\nreferring to is me. \\n\\n\"Why? You think she bought into that sappy romance \\nstuff?\" \\n\\n\"She might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. \\nEvery time I think about her spinning around in that \\ndress, I want to puke.\" \\n\\n\"Wish we knew how she got that eleven.\" \\n\\n\"Bet you Lover Boy knows.\" \\n\\nThe sound of Peeta returning silences them. \\n\\n\"Was she dead?\" asks the boy from District 2. \\n\\n\"No. But she is now,\" says Peeta. Just then, the \\ncannon fires. \"Ready to move on?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n155 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins \\nto break, and birdsong fills the air. I remain in my \\nawkward position, muscles trembling with exertion \\nfor a while longer, then hoist myself back onto my \\nbranch. I need to get down, to get going, but for a \\nmoment I lie there, digesting what I\\'ve heard. Not only \\nis Peeta with the Careers, he\\'s helping them find me. \\nThe simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously \\nbecause of her eleven. Because she can use a bow \\nand arrow. Which Peeta knows better than anyone. \\n\\nBut he hasn\\'t told them yet. Is he saving that \\ninformation because he knows it\\'s all that keeps him \\nalive? Is he still pretending to love me for the \\naudience? What is going on in his head? \\n\\nSuddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a high- \\npitched warning call. A single note. Just like the one \\nGale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was \\ncaught. High above the dying campfire a hovercraft \\nmaterializes. A set of huge metal teeth drops down. \\nSlowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the \\nhovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume their \\nsong. \\n\\n\"Move,\" I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my \\nsleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take \\na deep breath. While I\\'ve been concealed by darkness \\nand the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has \\nprobably been difficult for the cameras to get a good \\nshot of me. I know they must be tracking me now \\nthough. The minute I hit the ground, I\\'m guaranteed \\na close-up. \\n\\nThe audience will have been beside themselves, \\nknowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the \\nCareers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with \\nthem. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, \\n\\n\\n\\n156 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. \\nCertainly not confused or frightened. \\n\\nNo, I need to look one step ahead of the game. \\n\\nSo as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, \\nI pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on \\nme. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give \\na knowing smile. There! Let them figure out what that \\nmeans! \\n\\nI\\'m about to take off when I think of my snares. \\nMaybe it\\'s imprudent to check them with the others \\nso close. But have to. Too many years of hunting, I \\nguess. And the lure of possible meat. I\\'m rewarded \\nwith one fine rabbit. In no time, I\\'ve cleaned and \\ngutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, \\nand innards, under a pile of leaves. I\\'m wishing for a \\nfire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a \\nlesson I learned the hard way \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when I think of the \\ndead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, \\nthe coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the \\nrabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over \\nthe coals. \\n\\nI\\'m glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I \\ncan hunt, that I\\'m a good bet because I won\\'t be lured \\ninto traps as easily as the others will by hunger. \\nWhile the rabbit cooks, I grind up part of a charred \\nbranch and set about camouflaging my orange pack. \\nThe black tones it down, but I feel a layer of mud \\nwould definitely help. Of course, to have mud, I\\'d \\nneed water . . . \\n\\nI pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over \\nthe coals, and take off in the opposite direction the \\nCareers went. I eat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap \\nup the leftovers in my plastic for later. The meat stops \\n\\n\\n\\n157 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe grumbling in my stomach but does little to \\nquench my thirst. Water is my top priority now. \\n\\nAs I hike along, I feel certain I\\'m still holding the \\nscreen in the Capitol, so I\\'m careful to continue to \\nhide my emotions. But what a good time Claudius \\nTemplesmith must be having with his guest \\ncommentators, dissecting Peeta\\'s behavior, my \\nreaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed \\nhis true colors? How does this affect the betting odds? \\nWill we lose sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? \\nYes, I feel certain we do, or at least did. \\n\\nCertainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star- \\ncrossed lover dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he \\nhasn\\'t spoken much about me, we can still get some \\nmileage out of it. Maybe people will think it\\'s \\nsomething we plotted together if I seem like it amuses \\nme now. \\n\\nThe sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy \\nit seems overly bright. I coat my lips in some grease \\nfrom the rabbit and try to keep from panting, but it\\'s \\nno use. It\\'s only been a day and I\\'m dehydrating fast. \\nI try and think of everything I know about finding \\nwater. It runs downhill, so, in fact, continuing down \\ninto this valley isn\\'t a bad thing. If I could just locate \\na game trail or spot a particularly green patch of \\nvegetation, these might help me along, but nothing \\nseems to change. There\\'s just the slight gradual slope, \\nthe birds, the sameness to the trees. \\n\\nAs the day wears on, I know I\\'m headed for trouble. \\nWhat little urine I\\'ve been able to pass is a dark \\nbrown, my head is aching, and there\\'s a dry patch on \\nmy tongue that refuses to moisten. The sun hurts my \\neyes so I dig out my sunglasses, but when I put them \\non they do something funny to my vision, so I just \\nstuff them back in my pack. \\n\\n158 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s late afternoon when I think I\\'ve found help. I spot \\na cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, \\nto suck the sweet juices from the skins. But just as \\nI\\'m holding them to my lips, I get a hard look at them. \\nWhat I thought were blueberries have a slightly \\ndifferent shape, and when I break one open the \\ninsides are bloodred. I don\\'t recognize these berries, \\nperhaps they are edible, but I\\'m guessing this is some \\nevil trick on the part of the Gamemakers. Even the \\nplant instructor in the Training Center made a point \\nof telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 \\npercent sure they weren\\'t toxic. Something I already \\nknew, but I\\'m so thirsty it takes her reminder to give \\nme the strength to fling them away. \\n\\nFatigue is beginning to settle on me, but it\\'s not the \\nusual tiredness that follows a long hike. I have to stop \\nand rest frequently, although I know the only cure for \\nwhat ails me requires continued searching. I try a \\nnew tactic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 climbing a tree as high as I dare in my \\nshaky state \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to look for any signs of water. But as \\nfar as I can see in any direction, there\\'s the same \\nunrelenting stretch of forest. \\n\\nDetermined to go on until nightfall, I walk until I\\'m \\nstumbling over my own feet. \\n\\nExhausted, I haul myself up into a tree and belt \\nmyself in. I\\'ve no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone \\njust to give my mouth something to do. Night falls, \\nthe anthem plays, and high in the sky I see the \\npicture of the girl, who was apparently from District \\n8. The one Peeta went back to finish off. \\n\\nMy fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my \\nburning thirst. Besides, they were heading away from \\nme and by now they, too, will have to rest. With the \\nscarcity of water, they may even have had to return to \\nthe lake for refills. \\n\\n\\n\\n159 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe, that is the only course for me as well. \\n\\n\\n\\nMorning brings distress. My heads throbs with every \\nbeat of my heart. Simple movements send stabs of \\npain through my joints. I fall, rather than jump from \\nthe tree. It takes several minutes for me to assemble \\nmy gear. Somewhere inside me, I know this is wrong. \\nI should be acting with more caution, moving with \\nmore urgency. But my mind seems foggy and forming \\na plan is hard. I lean back against the trunk of my \\ntree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper \\nsurface of my tongue, as I assess my options. How \\ncan I get water? \\n\\nReturn to the lake. No good. I\\'d never make it. \\n\\nHope for rain. There\\'s not a cloud in the sky. \\n\\nKeep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, \\nanother thought hits me, and the surge of anger that \\nfollows brings me to me senses. \\n\\nHaymitch! He could send me water! Press a button \\nand have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in \\nminutes. I know I must have sponsors, at least one or \\ntwo who could afford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, it\\'s \\npricey, but these people, they\\'re made of money. And \\nthey\\'ll be betting on me as well. Perhaps Haymitch \\ndoesn\\'t realize how deep my need is. \\n\\nI say in a voice as loud as I dare. \"Water.\" I wait, \\nhopefully, for a parachute to descend from the sky. \\nBut nothing is forthcoming. \\n\\nSomething is wrong. Am I deluded about having \\nsponsors? Or has Peeta\\'s behavior made them all \\nhang back? No, I don\\'t believe it. There\\'s someone out \\nthere who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is \\nrefusing to let it go through. As my mentor, he gets to \\n\\n\\n\\n160 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncontrol the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I know he \\nhates me. He\\'s made that clear enough. But enough \\nto let me die? From this? He can\\'t do that, can he? If \\na mentor mistreats his tributes, hell be held \\naccountable by the viewers, by the people back in \\nDistrict 12. Even Haymitch wouldn\\'t risk that, would \\nhe? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the \\nHob, but I don\\'t think they\\'d welcome him back there \\nif he let me die this way. And then where would he get \\nhis liquor? So . . . what? Is he trying to make me suffer \\nfor defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors \\ntoward Peeta? Is he just too drunk to even notice \\nwhat\\'s going on at the moment? Somehow I don\\'t \\nbelieve that and I don\\'t believe he\\'s trying to kill me \\noff by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own \\nunpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me \\nfor this. Then what is going on? \\n\\nI bury my face in my hands. There\\'s no danger of \\ntears now, I couldn\\'t produce one to save my life. \\nWhat is Haymitch doing? Despite my anger, hatred, \\nand suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head \\nwhispers an answer. \\n\\nMaybe he\\'s sending you a message, it says. A \\nmessage. Saying what? Then I know. There\\'s only one \\ngood reason Haymitch could be withholding water \\nfrom me. Because he knows I\\'ve almost found it. \\n\\nI grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My \\nbackpack seems to have tripled in weight. I find a \\nbroken branch that will do for a walking stick and I \\nstart off. The sun\\'s beating down, even more searing \\nthan the first two days. I feel like an old piece of \\nleather, drying and cracking in the heat, every step is \\nan effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I \\nsit, there\\'s a good chance I won\\'t be able to get up \\nagain, that I won\\'t even remember my task. \\n\\n\\n\\n161 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, \\ncould take me right now, merely shove me over and \\nkill me with my own knife, and I\\'d have little strength \\nto resist. But if anyone is in my part of the woods, \\nthey ignore me. The truth is, I feel a million miles \\nfrom another living soul. \\n\\nNot alone though. No, they\\'ve surely got a camera \\ntracking me now. I think back to the years of \\nwatching tributes starve, freeze, bleed, and dehydrate \\nto death. Unless there\\'s a really good fight going on \\nsomewhere, I\\'m being featured. \\n\\nMy thoughts turn to Prim. It\\'s likely she won\\'t be \\nwatching me live, but theyll show updates at the \\nschool during lunch. For her sake, I try to look as \\nleast desperate as I can. \\n\\nBut by afternoon, I know the end is coming. My legs \\nare shaking and my heart too quick. I keep forgetting, \\nexactly what I\\'m doing. I\\'ve stumbled repeatedly and \\nmanaged to regain my feet, but when the stick slides \\nout from under me, I finally tumble to the ground \\nunable to get up. I let my eyes close. \\n\\nI have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of \\nhelping me at all. \\n\\nThis is all right, I think. This is not so bad here. The \\nair is less hot, signifying evening\\'s approach. There\\'s \\na slight, sweet scent that reminds me of lilies. My \\nfingers stroke the smooth ground, sliding easily \\nacross the top. This is an okay place to die, I think. \\n\\nMy fingertips make small swirling patterns in the \\ncool, slippery earth, ilove mud, I think. How many \\ntimes I\\'ve tracked game with the help of its soft, \\nreadable surface. Good for bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. \\nMud! My eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the \\n162 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nearth. It is mud! My nose lifts in the air. And those \\nare lilies! Pond lilies! \\n\\nI crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself \\ntoward the scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl \\nthrough a tangle of plants into a pond. Floating on \\nthe top, yellow flowers in bloom, are my beautiful \\nlilies. \\n\\nIt\\'s all I can do not to plunge my face into the water \\nand gulp down as much as I can hold. But I have jus \\nenough sense left to abstain. With trembling hands, I \\nget out my flask and fill it with water. I add what I \\nremember to be the right number of drops of iodine \\nfor purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is agony, \\nbut I do it. At least, \\n\\nI think it\\'s a half an hour, but it\\'s certainly as long as \\nI can stand. \\n\\nSlowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and \\nmake myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple \\nof hours, I drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. \\nI prepare another before I retire to a tree where I \\ncontinue sipping, eating rabbit, and even indulge in \\none of my precious crackers. By the time the anthem \\nplays, I feel remarkably better. There are no faces \\ntonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow 111 stay \\nhere, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, \\ncatching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped, \\ndigging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice \\nmeal. I snuggle down in my sleeping bag, hanging on \\nto my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is. \\n\\nA few hours later, the stampede of feet shakes me \\nfrom slumber. I look around in bewilderment. It\\'s not \\nyet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it. \\n\\n\\n\\n163 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIt would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on \\nme. \\n\\n\\n\\n164 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nMy first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I\\'m \\nbelted in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the \\nbuckle and I fall to the ground in a heap, still snarled \\nin my sleeping bag. There\\'s no time for any kind of \\npacking. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle \\nare already in the bag. I shove in the belt, hoist the \\nbag over my shoulder, and flee. \\n\\nThe world has transformed to flame and smoke. \\nBurning branches crack from trees and fall in \\nshowers of sparks at my feet. All I can do is follow the \\nothers, the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild \\ndog pack shooting through the woods. I trust their \\nsense of direction because their instincts are sharper \\nthan mine. But they are much faster, flying through \\nthe underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on \\nroots and fallen tree limbs, that there\\'s no way I can \\nkeep apace with them. \\n\\nThe heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the \\nsmoke, which threatens to suffocate me at any \\nmoment. I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose, \\ngrateful to find it soaked in sweat, and it offers a thin \\nveil of protection. And I run, choking, my bag banging \\nagainst my back, my face cut with branches that \\nmaterialize from the gray haze without warning, \\nbecause I know I am supposed to run. \\n\\nThis was no tribute\\'s campfire gone out of control, no \\naccidental occurrence. The flames that bear down on \\nme have an unnatural height, a uniformity that \\nmarks them as human-made, machine-made, \\nGamemaker-made. Things have been too quiet today. \\nNo deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in \\nthe Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these \\n165 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nGames are verging on dullness. This is the one thing \\nthe Games must not do. \\n\\nIt\\'s not hard to follow the Gamemakers\\' motivation. \\nThere is the Career pack and then there are the rest \\nof us, probably spread far and thin across the arena. \\nThis fire is designed to flush us out, to drive us \\ntogether. It may not be the most original device I\\'ve \\nseen, but it\\'s very, very effective. \\n\\nI hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail \\nend of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to \\nrip it from my body and stamp out the flames. But I \\ndon\\'t dare leave the jacket, scorched and smoldering \\nas it is, I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping \\nbag, hoping the lack of air will quell what I haven\\'t \\nextinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my \\nback, and it\\'s little enough to survive with. \\n\\nIn a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are \\nburning. The coughing begins soon after and my \\nlungs begin to feel as if they are actually being \\ncooked. Discomfort turns to distress until each breath \\nsends a searing pain through my chest. I manage to \\ntake cover under a stone outcropping just as the \\nvomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and \\nwhatever water has remained in my stomach. \\nCrouching on my hands and knees, I retch until \\nthere\\'s nothing left to come up. \\n\\nI know I need to keep moving, but I\\'m trembling and \\nlight-headed now, gasping for air. I allow myself about \\na spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then \\ntake a few swallows from my bottle. You get one \\nminute, I tell myself. One minute to rest. I take the \\ntime to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping bag, \\nand messily stuff everything into the backpack. My \\nminute\\'s up. I know it\\'s time to move on, but the \\nsmoke has clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed \\n166 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nanimals that were my compass have left me behind. I \\nknow I haven\\'t been in this part of the woods before, \\nthere were no sizable rocks like the one I\\'m sheltering \\nagainst on my earlier travels. Where are the \\nGamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a \\nwhole new terrain filled with new dangers? I had just \\nfound a few hours of peace at the pond when this \\nattack began. Would there be any way I could travel \\nparallel to the fire and work my way back there, to a \\nsource of water at least? The wall of fire must have an \\nend and it won\\'t burn indefinitely. Not because the \\nGamemakers couldn\\'t keep it fueled but because, \\nagain, that would invite accusations of boredom from \\nthe audience. If I could get back behind the fire line, I \\ncould avoid meeting up with the Careers. I\\'ve just \\ndecided to try and loop back around, although it will \\nrequire miles of travel away from the inferno and then \\na very circuitous route back, when the first fireball \\nblasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I \\nspring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed \\nfear. \\n\\nThe game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get \\nus moving, now the audience will get to see some real \\nfun. When I hear the next hiss, I flatten on the \\nground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a \\ntree off to my left, engulfing it in flames. To remain \\nstill is death. I\\'m barely on my feet before the third \\nball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a \\npillar of fire up behind me. Time loses meaning now \\nas I frantically try to dodge the attacks. I can\\'t see \\nwhere they\\'re being launched from, but it\\'s not a \\nhovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough. \\nProbably this whole segment of the woods has been \\narmed with precision launchers that are concealed in \\ntrees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless \\nroom, a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers \\non the triggers that could end my life in a second. All \\nthat is needed is a direct hit. \\n\\n\\n\\n167 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever vague plan I had conceived regarding \\nreturning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I \\nzigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs. Each \\none is only the size of an apple, but packs \\ntremendous power on contact. Every sense I have \\ngoes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. \\nThere\\'s no time to judge if a move is the correct one. \\nWhen there\\'s a hiss, I act or die. \\n\\nSomething keeps me moving forward, though. A \\nlifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know \\nthat certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain \\nattacks. And that if I can just get away from this \\nsection, I might be able to move out of reach of the \\nlaunchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit of \\nvipers, but I can\\'t worry about that now. \\n\\nHow long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I can\\'t \\nsay, but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is \\ngood, because I\\'m retching again. This time it\\'s an \\nacidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its \\nway into my nose as well. I\\'m forced to stop as my \\nbody convulses, trying desperately to rid itself of the \\npoisons I\\'ve been sucking in during the attack. I wait \\nfor the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn\\'t \\ncome. The force of the retching has squeezed tears \\nout of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in \\nsweat. Somehow, through the smoke and vomit, I \\npick up the scent of singed hair. My hand fumbles to \\nmy braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least \\nsix inches of it. Strands of blackened hair crumble in \\nmy fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the \\ntransformation, when the hissing registers. \\n\\nMy muscles react, only not fast enough this time. The \\nfireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not \\nbefore it skids across my right calf. Seeing my pants \\nleg on fire sends me over the edge. I twist and scuttle \\nbackward on my hands and feet, shrieking, trying to \\n168 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nremove myself from the horror. When I finally regain \\nenough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the \\nground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, \\nwithout thinking, I rip away the remaining fabric with \\nmy bare hands. \\n\\nI sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze set off \\nby the fireball. My calf is screaming, my hands \\ncovered in red welts. I\\'m shaking too hard to move. If \\nthe Gamemakers want to finish me off, now is the \\ntime. \\n\\nI hear Cinna\\'s voice, carrying images of rich fabric \\nand sparkling gems. \"Katniss, the girl who was on \\nfire.\" What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be \\nhaving over that one. Perhaps, Cinna\\'s beautiful \\ncostumes have even brought on this particular \\ntorture for me. I know he couldn\\'t have foreseen this, \\nmust be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he \\ncares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up \\nstark naked in that chariot would have been safer for \\nme. \\n\\nThe attack is now over. The Gamemakers don\\'t want \\nme dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could \\ndestroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The \\nreal sport of the Hunger Games is watching the \\ntributes kill one another. Every so often, they do kill a \\ntribute just to remind the players they can. But \\nmostly, they manipulate us into confronting one \\nanother face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer \\nbeing fired at, there is at least one other tribute close \\nat hand. \\n\\nI would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I \\ncould, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I \\nmake myself stand and begin to limp away from the \\nwall of flames that lights up the sky. It does not seem \\n\\n\\n\\n169 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nto be pursuing me any longer, except with its stinking \\nblack clouds. \\n\\nAnother light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls \\nof smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I \\ncan see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute \\ncould easily be concealed from me here. I should draw \\nmy knife as a precaution, but I doubt my ability to \\nhold it for long. The pain in my hands can in no way \\ncompete with that in my calf. I hate burns, have \\nalways hated them, even a small one gotten from \\npulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst \\nkind of pain to me, but I have never experienced \\nanything like this. \\n\\nI\\'m so weary I don\\'t even notice I\\'m in the pool until \\nI\\'m ankle-deep. It\\'s spring-fed, bubbling up out of a \\ncrevice in some rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my \\nhands into the shallow water and feel instant relief. \\nIsn\\'t that what my mother always says? The first \\ntreatment for a burn is cold water? That it draws out \\nthe heat? But she means minor burns. Probably she\\'d \\nrecommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? \\nAlthough I have not yet had the courage to examine \\nit, I\\'m guessing that it\\'s an injury in a whole different \\nclass. \\n\\nI lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while, \\ndangling my hands in the water, examining the little \\nflames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip \\noff. Good. I\\'ve had enough fire for a lifetime. \\n\\nI bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall \\nall I know about burns. They are common injuries in \\nthe Seam where we cook and heat our homes with \\ncoal. Then there are the mine accidents... . A family \\nonce brought in an unconscious young man pleading \\nwith my mother to help him. The district doctor who\\'s \\nresponsible for treating the miners had written him \\n170 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\noff, told the family to take him home to die. But they \\nwouldn\\'t accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, \\nsenseless to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound \\non his thigh, gaping, charred flesh, burned clear \\ndown to the bone, before I ran from the house. I went \\nto the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted by \\nthe gruesome leg, memories of my father\\'s death. \\nWhat\\'s funny was, Prim, who\\'s scared of her own \\nshadow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers \\nare born, not made. They did their best, but the man \\ndied, just like the doctor said he would. \\n\\nMy leg is in need of attention, but I still can\\'t look at \\nit. What if it\\'s as bad as the man\\'s and I can see my \\nbone? Then I remember my mother saying that if a \\nburn\\'s severe, the victim might not even feel pain \\nbecause the nerves would be destroyed. Encouraged \\nby this, I sit up and swing my leg in front of me. \\n\\nI almost faint at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a \\nbrilliant red covered with blisters. I force myself to \\ntake deep, slow breaths, feeling quite certain the \\ncameras are on my face. I can\\'t show weakness at this \\ninjury. Not if I want help. Pity does not get you aid. \\nAdmiration at your refusal to give in does. I cut the \\nremains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine \\nthe injury more closely. The burned area is about the \\nsize of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I \\nthink it\\'s not too bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out \\nmy leg into the pool, propping the heel of my boot on \\na rock so the leather doesn\\'t get too sodden, and sigh, \\nbecause this does offer some relief. I know there are \\nherbs, if I could find them, that would speed the \\nhealing, but I can\\'t quite call them to mind. Water \\nand time will probably be all I have to work with. \\n\\nShould I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing \\nbut still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away \\nfrom the fire, won\\'t I be walking straight into the \\n171 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nweapons of the Careers? Besides, every time I lift my \\nleg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely I \\nhave to slide it back in. My hands are slightly less \\ndemanding. They can handle small breaks from the \\npool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill \\nmy bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when \\nenough time has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. \\nAfter a time, I force myself to nibble on a cracker, \\nwhich helps settle my stomach. I roll up my sleeping \\nbag. Except for a few black marks, it\\'s relatively \\nunscathed. My jacket\\'s another matter. Stinking and \\nscorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair. I \\ncut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment \\nthat comes just to the bottom of my ribs. But the \\nhood\\'s intact and it\\'s far better than nothing. \\n\\nDespite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I\\'d \\ntake to a tree and try to rest, except I\\'d be too easy to \\nspot. Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. \\nI neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on \\nmy shoulders, but I can\\'t seem to leave. I spot some \\nwater plants with edible roots and make a small meal \\nwith my last piece of rabbit. Sip water. Watch the sun \\nmake its slow arc across the sky. Where would I go \\nanyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on \\nmy pack, overcome by drowsiness. If the Careers \\nwant me, let them find me, I think before drifting into \\na stupor. Let them find me. \\n\\nAnd find me, they do. It\\'s lucky I\\'m ready to move on \\nbecause when I hear the feet, I have less than a \\nminute head start. Evening has begun to fall. The \\nmoment I awake, I\\'m up and running, splashing \\nacross the pool, flying into the underbrush. My leg \\nslows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not as \\nspeedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their \\ncoughs, their raspy voices calling to one another. \\n\\n\\n\\n172 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nStill, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, \\nand so I do what I have done my whole life in such \\ncircumstances. I pick a high tree and begin to climb. \\nIf running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it \\nrequires not only exertion but direct contact of my \\nhands on the tree bark. I\\'m fast, though, and by the \\ntime they\\'ve reached the base of my trunk, I\\'m twenty \\nfeet up. For a moment, we stop and survey one \\nanother. I hope they can\\'t hear the pounding of my \\nheart. \\n\\nThis could be it, I think. What chance do I have \\nagainst them? All six are there, the five Careers and \\nPeeta, and my only consolation is they\\'re pretty beat- \\nup, too. Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their \\nfaces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above \\nthem. It seems pretty hopeless. But then something \\nelse registers. They\\'re bigger and stronger than I am, \\nno doubt, but they\\'re also heavier. There\\'s a reason \\nit\\'s me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the \\nhighest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests. I \\nmust weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the \\nsmallest Career. \\n\\nNow I smile. \"How\\'s everything with you?\" I call down \\ncheerfully. \\n\\nThis takes them aback, but I know the crowd will love \\nit. \\n\\n\"Well enough,\" says the boy from District \\n2. \"Yourself?\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s been a bit warm for my taste,\" I say. I can almost \\nhear the laughter from the Capitol. \"The air\\'s better \\nup here. Why don\\'t you come on up?\" \\n\\n\"Think I will,\" says the same boy. \\n\\n\\n\\n173 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here, take this, Cato,\" says the girl from District 1, \\nand she offers him the silver bow and sheath of \\narrows. My bow! My arrows! Just the sight of them \\nmakes me so angry I want to scream, at myself, at \\nthat traitor Peeta for distracting me from having \\nthem. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he \\nseems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he \\npolishes his knife with the edge of his shirt. \\n\\n\"No,\" says Cato, pushing away the bow. \"Ill do better \\nwith my sword.\" I can see the weapon, a short, heavy \\nblade at his belt. \\n\\nI give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I \\nbegin to climb again. Gale always says I remind him \\nof a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the \\nslenderest limb. Part of it\\'s my weight, but part of it\\'s \\npractice. You have to know where to place your hands \\nand feet. I\\'m another thirty feet in the air when I hear \\nthe crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and \\na branch go down. He hits the ground hard and I\\'m \\nhoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back \\nto his feet, swearing like a fiend. \\n\\nThe girl with the arrows, Glimmer I hear someone call \\nher \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ugh, the names the people in District 1 give \\ntheir children are so ridiculous \\xe2\\x80\\x94 anyway Glimmer \\nscales the tree until the branches begin to crack \\nunder her feet and then has the good sense to stop. \\nI\\'m at least eighty feet high now. She tries to shoot me \\nand it\\'s immediately evident that she\\'s incompetent \\nwith a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree \\nnear me though and I\\'m able to seize it. I wave it \\nteasingly above her head, as if this was the sole \\npurpose of retrieving it, when actually I mean to use it \\nif I ever get the chance. I could kill them, everyone of \\nthem, if those silver weapons were in my hands. \\n\\n\\n\\n174 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear \\nthem growling conspiratorially among themselves, \\nfurious I have made them look foolish. But twilight \\nhas arrived and their window of attack on me is \\nclosing. Finally, I hear Peeta say harshly, \"Oh, let her \\nstay up there. It\\'s not like she\\'s going anywhere. We\\'ll \\ndeal with her in the morning.\" \\n\\nWell, he\\'s right about one thing. I\\'m going nowhere. \\nAll the relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me \\nto feel the full potency of my burns. I scoot down to a \\nfork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed. Put on \\nmy jacket. Lay out my sleeping bed. Belt myself in \\nand try to keep from moaning. The heat of the bag\\'s \\ntoo much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and \\nhang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on \\nthe wound, my hands. \\n\\nAll my bravado is gone. I\\'m weak from pain and \\nhunger but can\\'t bring myself to eat. Even if I can last \\nthe night, what will the morning bring? I stare into \\nthe foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns \\nforbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing \\nlullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An \\nowl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through \\nthe smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from \\nthe neighboring tree \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a possum maybe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 catching \\nthe firelight from the Careers \\'torches. Suddenly, I\\'m \\nup on one elbow. Those are no possum\\'s eyes, I know \\ntheir glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not \\nanimal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make \\nher out, watching me silently from between the \\nbranches. Rue. \\n\\nHow long has she been here? The whole time \\nprobably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded \\nbeneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree shortly \\nbefore I did, hearing the pack was so close. \\n\\n\\n\\n175 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nFor a while we hold each other\\'s gaze. Then, without \\neven rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the \\nopen and points to something above my head. \\n\\n\\n\\n176 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nMy eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage \\nabove me. At first, I have no idea what she\\'s pointing \\nto, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the \\nvague shape in the dimming light. But of ... of what? \\nSome sort of animal? It looks about the size of a \\nraccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, \\nswaying ever so slightly. There\\'s something else. \\nAmong the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my \\nears register a low hum. Then I know. It\\'s a wasp \\nnest. \\n\\nFear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to \\nkeep still. After all, I don\\'t know what kind of wasp \\nlives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone- \\nand-well-leave-you-alone type. But these are the \\nHunger Games, and ordinary isn\\'t the norm. More \\nlikely they will be one of the Capitol\\'s muttations, \\ntracker j ackers. Like the jabberjays, thesekiller wasps \\nwere spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like \\nland mines, around the districts during the war. \\nLarger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive \\nsolid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the size \\nof a plum on contact. Most people can\\'t tolerate more \\nthan a few stings. Some die at once. If you live, the \\nhallucinations brought on by the venom have actually \\ndriven people to madness. And there\\'s another thing, \\nthese wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs \\ntheir nest and attempt to kill them. That\\'s where the \\ntracker part of the name comes from. \\n\\nAfter the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests \\nsurrounding their city, but the ones near the districts \\nwere left untouched. Another reminder of our \\nweakness, I suppose, just like the Hunger Games. \\nAnother reason to keep inside the fence of District 12. \\n177 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest, \\nwe immediately head in the opposite direction. \\n\\nSo is that what hangs above me? I look back to Rue \\nfor help, but she\\'s melted into her tree. \\n\\nGiven my circumstances, I guess it doesn\\'t matter \\nwhat type of wasp nest it is. I\\'m wounded and \\ntrapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but \\nby the time the sun rises, the Careers will have \\nformulated a plan to kill me. There\\'s no way they \\ncould do otherwise after I\\'ve made them look so \\nstupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If \\nI can drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. \\nBut I\\'ll risk my life in the process. \\n\\nOf course, I\\'ll never be able to get in close enough to \\nthe actual nest to cut it free. I\\'ll have to saw off the \\nbranch at the trunk and send the whole thing down. \\nThe serrated portion of my knife should be able to \\nmanage that. But can my hands? And will the \\nvibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And what \\nif the Careers figure out what I\\'m doing and move \\ntheir camp? That would defeat the whole purpose. \\n\\nI realize that the best chance I\\'ll have to do the sawing \\nwithout drawing notice will be during the anthem. \\nThat could begin any time. I drag myself out of my \\nbag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and \\nbegin to make my way up the tree. This in itself is \\ndangerous since the branches are becoming \\nprecariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I \\nreach the limb that supports the nest, the humming \\nbecomes more distinctive. But it\\'s still oddly subdued \\nif these are tracker jackers. It\\'s the smoke, I think. It\\'s \\nsedated them. This was the one defense the rebels \\nfound to battle the wasps. \\n\\n\\n\\n178 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe seal of the Capitol shines above me and the \\nanthem blares out. It\\'s now or never, I think, and \\nbegin to saw. Blisters burst on my right hand as I \\nawkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once I\\'ve \\ngot a groove, the work requires less effort but is \\nalmost more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and \\nsaw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register \\nthat there were no deaths today. That\\'s all right. The \\naudience will be sated seeing me injured and treed \\nand the pack below me. But the anthem\\'s running \\nout and I\\'m only three quarters of the way through \\nthe wood when the music ends, the sky goes dark, \\nand I\\'m forced to stop. \\n\\nNow what? I could probably finish off the job by sense \\nof feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the \\nwasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way \\ndown, if I try to escape, this could all be a deadly \\nwaste of time. Better, I think, to sneak up here at \\ndawn and send the nest into my enemies. \\n\\nIn the faint light of the Careers\\' torches, I inch back \\ndown to my fork to find the best surprise I\\'ve ever \\nhad. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot \\nattached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a \\nsponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during \\nthe anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my \\nhand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the \\nlid and I know by the scent that it\\'s medicine. \\nCautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The \\nthrobbing in my fingertip vanishes. \\n\\n\"Oh, Haymitch,\" I whisper. \"Thank you.\" He has not \\nabandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. \\nThe cost of this medicine must be astronomical. \\nProbably not one but many sponsors have \\ncontributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is \\npriceless. \\n\\n\\n\\n179 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm \\nover my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the \\npain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation \\nbehind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother \\ngrinds up out of woodland plants, it\\'s high-tech \\nmedicine brewed up in the Capitol\\'s labs. When my \\ncalf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After \\nwrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely \\naway in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it\\'s all \\nI can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge \\ninto sleep. \\n\\nA bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that \\na new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I \\nexamine my hands. The medicine has transformed all \\nthe angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg \\nstill feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I \\napply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up \\nmy gear. Whatever happens, I\\'m going to have to \\nmove and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker \\nand a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water. \\n\\nAlmost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and \\nI\\'m already starting to feel the effects of hunger. \\n\\nBelow me, I can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep \\non the ground. By her position, leaning up against \\nthe trunk of the tree, I\\'d guess Glimmer was \\nsupposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her. \\n\\nMy eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next \\nto me, but I can\\'t make out Rue. Since she tipped me \\noff, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if I\\'m going \\nto die today, it\\'s Rue I want to win. Even if it means a \\nlittle extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being \\ncrowned victor is unbearable. \\n\\nI call Rue\\'s name in a hushed whisper and the eyes \\nappear, wide and alert, at once. She points up to the \\n180 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nnest again. I hold up my knife and make a sawing \\nmotion. She nods and disappears. There\\'s a rustling \\nin a nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit \\nfarther off. I realize she\\'s leaping from tree to tree. It\\'s \\nall I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she \\nshowed the Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around \\nthe training equipment never touching the floor. She \\nshould have gotten at least a ten. \\n\\nRosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I can\\'t \\nafford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of \\nlast night\\'s climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb \\nthat holds the nest, I position the knife in the groove \\nand I\\'m about to draw the teeth across the wood \\nwhen I see something moving. There, on the nest. The \\nbright gold gleam of a tracker j acker lazily making its \\nway across the papery gray surface. No question, it\\'s \\nacting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and \\nmoving and that means the others will be out soon as \\nwell. Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands, \\nbeading up through the ointment, and I do my best to \\npat them dry on my shirt. If I don\\'t get through this \\nbranch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm \\ncould emerge and attack me. \\n\\nThere\\'s no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, \\ngrip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. \\nBack, forth, back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to \\nbuzz and I hear them coming out. Back, forth, back, \\nforth! A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I \\nknow one has found me and the others will be honing \\nin. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife cuts \\nthrough, I shove the end of the branch as far away \\nfrom me as I can. It crashes down through the lower \\nbranches, snagging temporarily on a few but then \\ntwisting free until it smashes with a thud on the \\nground. The nest bursts open like an egg, and a \\nfurious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air. \\n\\n\\n\\n181 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, \\nand their venom almost immediately makes me \\nwoozy. I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the \\nbarbed stingers out of my flesh. Fortunately, only \\nthese three tracker jackers had identified me before \\nthe nest went down. The rest of the insects have \\ntargeted their enemies on the ground. \\n\\nIt\\'s mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale \\ntracker jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the \\nsense to drop everything and bolt. I can hear cries of \\n\"To the lake! To the lake!\" and know they hope to \\nevade the wasps by taking to the water. It must be \\nclose if they think they can outdistance the furious \\ninsects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from \\nDistrict 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple \\nstings before they\\'re even out of my view. Glimmer \\nappears to go completely mad, shrieking and trying to \\nbat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless. \\nShe calls to the others for help but, of course, no one \\nreturns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight, \\nalthough I wouldn\\'t bet on her making it to the lake. I \\nwatch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the \\nground for a few minutes, and then go still. \\n\\nThe nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps \\nhave vanished in pursuit of the others. I don\\'t think \\nthey\\'ll return, but I don\\'t want to risk it. I scamper \\ndown the tree and hit the ground running in the \\nopposite direction of the lake. The poison from the \\nstingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way back to \\nmy own little pool and submerge myself in the water, \\njust in case any wasps are still on my trail. After \\nabout five minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. \\nPeople have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker \\njacker stings. Actually, the one on my knee is closer \\nto an orange than a plum in size. A foul- smelling \\ngreen liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out \\nthe stingers. \\n\\n182 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer \\ntwitching to death on the ground. It\\'s a lot to handle \\nbefore the sun has even cleared the horizon. I don\\'t \\nwant to think about what Glimmer must look like \\nnow. Her body disfigured. Her swollen fingers \\nstiffening around the bow . . . \\n\\nThe bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one \\nthought connects to another and I\\'m on my feet, \\nteetering through the trees back to Glimmer. The \\nbow. The arrows. I must get them. I haven\\'t heard the \\ncannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort \\nof coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp \\nvenom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her \\ndeath, a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, \\ntaking the only bow and sheath of arrows I\\'ve seen \\nout of the Games for good. And I refuse to let them \\nslip through my fingers again! \\n\\nI reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker \\njackers have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly \\nbeautiful in her golden dress the night of the \\ninterviews, is unrecognizable. Her features eradicated, \\nher limbs three times their normal size. The stinger \\nlumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green \\nliquid around her. I have to break several of what \\nused to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. \\nThe sheath of arrows is pinned under her back. I try \\nto roll over her body by pulling on one arm, but the \\nflesh disintegrates in my hands and I fall back on the \\nground. \\n\\nIs this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I \\nsqueeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my \\nmouth, ordering myself not to become sick. Breakfast \\nmust stay down, it might be days before I can hunt \\nagain. A second cannon fires and I\\'m guessing the girl \\nfrom District 4 has just died. I hear the birds fall \\nsilent and then one give the warning call, which \\n183 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmeans a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I \\nthink it\\'s for Glimmer, although this doesn\\'t quite \\nmake sense because I\\'m still in the picture, still \\nfighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto my knees \\nand the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In \\nthe middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw \\nmyself over Glimmer\\'s body as if to protect it but then \\nI see the girl from District 4 being lifted into the air \\nand vanishing. \\n\\n\"Do this!\" I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig \\nmy hands under Glimmer\\'s body, get a hold on what \\nmust be her rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. \\nI can\\'t help it, I\\'m hyperventilating now, the whole \\nthing is so nightmarish and I\\'m losing my grasp on \\nwhat\\'s real. I tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but \\nit\\'s caught on something, her shoulder blade, \\nsomething, and finally yank it free. I\\'ve just encircled \\nthe sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, \\nseveral pairs, coming through the underbrush, and I \\nrealize the Careers have come back. They\\'ve come \\nback to kill me or get their weapons or both. \\n\\nBut it\\'s too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the \\nsheath and try to position it on the bowstring but \\ninstead of one string I see three and the stench from \\nthe stings is so repulsive I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t do it. I \\ncan\\'t do it. \\n\\nI\\'m helpless as the first hunter crashes through the \\ntrees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on \\nPeeta\\'s face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow. \\nInstead his arm drops to his side. \\n\\n\"What are you still doing here?\" he hisses at me. I \\nstare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips \\noff a sting under his ear. His whole body starts \\nsparkling as if he\\'s been dipped in dew. \"Are you \\nmad?\" He\\'s prodding me with the shaft of the spear \\n184 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nnow. \"Get up! Get up!\" I rise, but he\\'s still pushing at \\nme. What? What is going on? He shoves me away \\nfrom him hard. \"RunF\\'he screams. \"Run!\" \\n\\nBehind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. \\nHe\\'s sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one \\neye. I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do \\nas Peeta says. Holding tightly to my bow and arrows, \\nbanging into trees that appear out of nowhere, \\ntripping and falling as I try to keep my balance. Back \\npast my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world \\nbegins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons \\nto the size of a house then shatters into a million \\nstars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over \\nmy boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on \\nmy hands and I can\\'t shake them free. They\\'re \\nclimbing up my arms, my neck. Someone\\'s \\nscreaming, a long high pitched scream that never \\nbreaks for breath. I have a vague idea it might be me. \\nI trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange \\nbubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest. \\nTucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for death. \\n\\nSick and disoriented, I\\'m able to form only one \\nthought: Peeta Mellark just saved my life. \\n\\nThen the ants bore into my eyes and I black out. \\n\\n\\n\\n185 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only \\nto find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I \\ndread most, all the things I dread for others manifest \\nin such vivid detail I can\\'t help but believe they\\'re \\nreal. Each time I wake, I think, At last, this is over, \\nbut it isn\\'t. It\\'s only the beginning of a new chapter of \\ntorture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive \\nmy father\\'s last moments? Feel my own body ripped \\napart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, \\nso carefully created to target the place where fear lives \\nin your brain. \\n\\nWhen I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting \\nfor the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I \\naccept that the poison must have finally worked its \\nway out of my system, leaving my body wracked and \\nfeeble. I\\'m still lying on my side, locked in the fetal \\nposition. I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound, \\nuntouched by ants that never existed. Simply \\nstretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. \\nSo many parts of me hurt, it doesn\\'t seem worthwhile \\ntaking inventory of them. Very, very slowly I manage \\nto sit up. I\\'m in a shallow hole, not filled with the \\nhumming orange bubbles of my hallucination but \\nwith old, dead leaves. My clothing\\'s damp, but I don\\'t \\nknow whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the \\ncause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips \\nfrom my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of \\na honeysuckle bush. \\n\\nHow long have I been out? It was morning when I lost \\nreason. Now it\\'s afternoon. But the stiffness in my \\njoints suggests more than a day has passed, even two \\npossibly. If so, 111 have no way of knowing which \\ntributes survived that tracker jacker attack. Not \\n186 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nGlimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was the \\nboy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and \\nPeeta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they \\nlived, their last days must have been as horrid as my \\nown. And what about Rue? She\\'s so small, it wouldn\\'t \\ntake much venom to do her in. But then again ... the \\ntracker j ackers would\\'ve had to catch her, and she \\nhad a good head start. \\n\\nA foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water \\nhas little effect on it. I drag myself over to the \\nhoneysuckle bush and pluck a flower. I gently pull \\nthe stamen through the blossom and set the drop of \\nnectar on my tongue. The sweetness spreads through \\nmy mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with \\nmemories of summer, and my home woods and Gale\\'s \\npresence beside me. For some reason, our discussion \\nfrom that last morning comes back to me. \\n\\n\"We could do it, you know.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" \\n\\n\"Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You \\nand I, we could make it.\" \\n\\nAnd suddenly, I\\'m not thinking of Gale but of Peeta \\nand ... Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by \\nthe time we met up, I couldn\\'t tell what was real and \\nwhat the tracker j acker venom had caused me to \\nimagine. But if he did, and my instincts tell me he \\ndid, what for? Is he simply working the Lover Boy \\nangle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually \\ntrying to protect me? And if he was, what was he \\ndoing with those Careers in the first place? None of it \\nmakes sense. \\n\\nI wonder what Gale made of the incident for a \\nmoment and then I push the whole thing out of my \\n187 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not \\ncoexist well together in my thoughts. \\n\\nSo I focus on the one really good thing that\\'s \\nhappened since I landed in the arena. I have a bow \\nand arrows! A full dozen arrows if you count the one I \\nretrieved in the tree. They bear no trace of the \\nnoxious green slime that came from Glimmer\\'s body \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which leads me to believe that might not have been \\nwholly real \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but they have a fair amount of dried \\nblood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a \\nminute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are \\nmore like the weapons in the Training Center than my \\nones at home, but who cares? That I can work with. \\n\\nThe weapons give me an entirely new perspective on \\nthe Games. I know I have tough opponents left to \\nface. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and \\nhides or takes desperate measures. If Cato broke \\nthrough the trees right now, I wouldn\\'t flee, I\\'d shoot. \\nI find I\\'m actually anticipating the moment with \\npleasure. \\n\\nBut first, I have to get some strength back in my \\nbody. I\\'m very dehydrated again and my water supply \\nis dangerously low. The little padding I was able to \\nput on by gorging myself during prep time in the \\nCapitol is gone, plus several more pounds as well. My \\nhip bones and ribs are more prominent than I \\nremember them being since those awful months after \\nmy father\\'s death. And then there are my wounds to \\ncontend with \\xe2\\x80\\x94 burns, cuts, and bruises from \\nsmashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker \\nstings, which are as sore and swollen as ever. I treat \\nmy burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on \\nmy stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My \\nmother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf \\nthat could draw out the poison, but she seldom had \\n\\n\\n\\n188 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncause to use it, and I don\\'t even remember its name \\nlet alone its appearance. \\n\\nWater first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. \\nIt\\'s easy to see the direction I came from by the path \\nof destruction my crazed body made through the \\nfoliage. So I walk off in the other direction, hoping my \\nenemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker \\nj acker venom. \\n\\nI can\\'t move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt \\nmotions. But I establish the slow hunter\\'s tread I use \\nwhen tracking game. Within a few minutes, I spot a \\nrabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. \\nIt\\'s not my usual clean shot through the eye, but 111 \\ntake it. After about an hour, I find a stream, shallow \\nbut wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The \\nsun\\'s hot and severe, so while I wait for my water to \\npurify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into \\nthe mild current. I\\'m filthy from head to toe, I try \\nsplashing myself but eventually just lay down in the \\nwater for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot \\nand blood and skin that has started to peel off my \\nburns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them \\non bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a \\nbit, untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite \\nreturns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a \\nhandful of moss, I polish the blood from my silver \\nweapons. \\n\\nRefreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my \\nhair, and dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun \\nwill dry them soon enough. Following the stream \\nagainst its current seems the smartest course of \\naction. I\\'m traveling uphill now, which I prefer, with a \\nsource of fresh water not only for myself but possible \\ngame. I easily take out a strange bird that must be \\nsome form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty \\nedible to me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a \\n189 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsmall fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help \\nconceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by \\nnightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care with the \\nbird, but there\\'s nothing alarming about it. Once the \\nfeathers are plucked, it\\'s no bigger than a chicken, \\nbut it\\'s plump and firm. I\\'ve just placed the first lot \\nover the coals when I hear the twig snap. \\n\\nIn one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow \\nand arrow to my shoulder. There\\'s no one there. No \\none I can see anyway. Then I spot the tip of a child\\'s \\nboot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. \\nMy shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through \\nthe woods like a shadow, you have to give her that. \\nHow else could she have followed me? The words \\ncome out of my mouth before I can stop them. \\n\\n\"You know, they\\'re not the only ones who can form \\nalliances,\" I say. \\n\\nFor a moment, no response. Then one of Rue\\'s eyes \\nedges around the trunk. \"You want me for an ally?\" \\n\\n\"Why not? You saved me with those tracker j ackers. \\nYou\\'re smart enough to still be alive. And I can\\'t seem \\nto shake you anyway,\" I say. She blinks at me, trying \\nto decide. \"You hungry?\" I can see her swallow hard, \\nher eye flickering to the meat. \"Come on then, I\\'ve had \\ntwo kills today.\" \\n\\nRue tentatively steps out into the open. \"I can fix your \\nstings.\" \\n\\n\"Can you?\" I ask. \"How?\" \\n\\nShe digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a \\nhandful of leaves. I\\'m almost certain they\\'re the ones \\nmy mother uses. \"Where \\'d you find those?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n190 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Just around. We all carry them when we work in the \\norchards. They left a lot of nests there,\" says Rue. \\n\"There are a lot here, too.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s right. You\\'re District Eleven. Agriculture,\" I \\nsay. \"Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly \\naround the trees like you\\'ve got wings.\" Rue smiles. \\nI\\'ve landed on one of the few things shell admit pride \\nin. \"Well, come on, then. Fix me up.\" \\n\\nI plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to \\nreveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue \\nplaces the handful of leaves into her mouth and \\nbegins to chew them. My mother would use other \\nmethods, but it\\'s not like we have a lot of options. \\nAfter a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad \\nof chewed leaves and spit on my knee. \\n\\n\"Ohhh.\" The sound comes out of my mouth before I \\ncan stop it. It\\'s as if the leaves are actually leaching \\nthe pain right out of the sting. \\n\\nRue gives a giggle. \"Lucky you had the sense to pull \\nthe stingers out or you\\'d be a lot worse.\" \\n\\n\"Do my neck! Do my cheek!\" I almost beg. \\n\\nRue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, \\nand soon I\\'m laughing because the relief is so sweet. I \\nnotice a long burn on Rue\\'s forearm. \"I\\'ve got \\nsomething for that.\" I set aside my weapons and \\nanoint her arm with the burn medicine. \\n\\n\"You have good sponsors,\" she says longingly. \\n\\n\"Have you gotten anything yet?\" I ask. She shakes her \\nhead. \"You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to \\nthe end, the more people will realize how clever you \\nare.\" I turn the meat over. \\n\\n\\n\\n191 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You weren\\'t joking, about wanting me for an ally?\" \\nshe asks. \\n\\n\"No, I meant it,\" I say. I can almost hear Haymitch \\ngroaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I \\nwant her. Because she\\'s a survivor, and I trust her, \\nand why not admit it? She reminds me of Prim. \\n\\n\"Okay,\" she says, and holds out her hand. We \\nshake.\"It\\'s a deal.\" \\n\\nOf course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, \\nbut neither of us mentions that. \\n\\nRue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy \\nroot to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the \\nsharp sweet taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the \\nbird, too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her \\ndistrict. She says sometimes a flock will wander into \\nthe orchard and they get a decent lunch that day. For \\na while, all conversation stops as we fill our \\nstomachs. The groosling has delicious meal that\\'s so \\nfatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite \\ninto it. \\n\\n\"Oh,\" says Rue with a sigh. \"I\\'ve never had a whole leg \\nto myself before.\" \\n\\nI\\'ll bet she hasn\\'t. Ill bet meat hardly ever comes her \\nway. \"Take the other,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Really?\" she asks. \\n\\n\"Take whatever you want. Now that I\\'ve got a bow and \\narrows, I can get more. Plus I\\'ve got snares. I can \\nshow you how to set them,\" I say. Rue still looks \\nuncertainly at the leg. \"Oh, take it,\" I say, putting the \\ndrumstick in her hands. \"It will only keep a few days \\nanyway, and we\\'ve got the whole bird plus the \\n192 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nrabbit. \"Once she\\'s got hold of it, her appetite wins out \\nand she takes a huge mouthful. \\n\\n\"I\\'d have thought, in District Eleven, you\\'d have a bit \\nmore to eat than us. You know, since you grow the \\nfood,\" I say. \\n\\nRue\\'s eyes widen. \"Oh, no, we\\'re not allowed to eat \\nthe crops.\" \\n\\n\"They arrest you or something?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"They whip you and make everyone else watch,\" says \\nRue. \"The mayor\\'s very strict about it.\" \\n\\nI can tell by her expression that it\\'s not that \\nuncommon an occurrence. A public whipping\\'s a rare \\nthing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. \\nTechnically, Gale and I could be whipped on a daily \\nbasis for poaching in the woods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well, technically, \\nwe could get a whole lot worse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 except all the \\nofficials buy our meat. Besides, our mayor, Madge\\'s \\nfather, doesn\\'t seem to have much taste for such \\nevents. Maybe being the least prestigious, poorest, \\nmost ridiculed district in the country has its \\nadvantages. Such as, being largely ignored by the \\nCapitol as long as we produce our coal quotas. \\n\\n\"Do you get all the coal you want?\" Rue asks. \\n\\n\"No,\" I answer. \"Just what we buy and whatever we \\ntrack in on our boots.\" \\n\\n\"They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that \\npeople can keep going longer,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t you have to be in school?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not during harvest. Everyone works then,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\\n\\n193 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting, hearing about her life. We have so \\nlittle communication with anyone outside our district. \\nIn fact, I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out \\nour conversation, because even though the \\ninformation seems harmless, they don\\'t want people \\nin different districts to know about one another. \\n\\nAt Rue\\'s suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan \\nahead. She\\'s seen most of mine, but I add the last \\ncouple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. She\\'s \\ngathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and \\neven some berries. \\n\\nI roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. \"You sure this \\nis safe?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, yes, we have them back home. I\\'ve been eating \\nthem for days,\" she says, popping a handful in her \\nmouth. I tentatively bite into one, and it\\'s as good as \\nour blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a \\nbetter choice all the time. We divide up our food \\nsupplies, so in case we\\'re separated, well both be set \\nfor a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small \\nwater skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair \\nof socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses \\nas a knife. \"I know it\\'s not much, \"she says as if \\nembarrassed, \"but I had to get away from the \\nCornucopia fast.\" \\n\\n\"You did just right,\" I say. When I spread out my gear, \\nshe gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses. \\n\\n\"How did you get those?\" she asks. \\n\\n\"In my pack. They\\'ve been useless so far. They don\\'t \\nblock the sun and they make it harder to see,\" I say \\nwith a shrug. \\n\\n\\n\\n194 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"These aren\\'t for sun, they\\'re for darkness,\" exclaims \\nRue. \"Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, \\nthey\\'ll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in \\nthe trees. Where the torchlight doesn\\'t reach. One \\ntime, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it \\nin his pants. They killed him on the spot.\" \\n\\n\"They killed a boy for taking these?\" I say. \\n\\n\"Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin \\nwasn\\'t right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a \\nthree-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play \\nwith,\" says Rue. \\n\\nHearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some \\nsort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from \\nstarvation all the time, but I can\\'t imagine the \\nPeacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. \\nThere\\'s a little girl, one of Greasy Sae\\'s grandkids, \\nwho wanders around the Hob. She\\'s not quite right, \\nbut she\\'s treated as a sort of pet. People toss her \\nscraps and things. \\n\\n\"So what do these do?\" I ask Rue, taking the glasses. \\n\\n\"They let you see in complete darkness,\" says Rue. \\n\"Try them tonight when the sun goes down.\" \\n\\nI give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have \\nplenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We \\nextinguish our fire and head upstream until it\\'s \\nalmost nightfall. \\n\\n\"Where do you sleep?\" I ask her. \"In the trees?\" She \\nnods. \"In just your jacket?\" \\n\\nRue holds up her extra pair of socks. \"I have these for \\nmy hands.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n195 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI think of how cold the nights have been. \"You can \\nshare my sleeping bag if you want. Well both easily \\nfit.\" Her face lights up. I can tell this is more than she \\ndared hope for. \\n\\nWe pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the \\nnight just as the anthem begins to play. There were \\nno deaths today. \\n\\n\"Rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I \\nmiss?\"The anthem should block out our words, but \\nstill I whisper. I even take the precaution of covering \\nmy lips with my hand. I don\\'t want the audience to \\nknow what I\\'m planning to tell her about Peeta. \\nTaking a cue from me, she does the same. \\n\\n\"Two,\" she says. \"The girls from Districts One and \\nFour are dead. There\\'s ten of us left.\" \\n\\n\"Something strange happened. At least, I think it did. \\nIt might have been the tracker j acker venom making \\nme imagine things,\" I say. \"You know the boy from my \\ndistrict? Peeta? I think he saved my life. But he was \\nwith the Careers.\" \\n\\n\"He\\'s not with them now,\" she says. \"I\\'ve spied on \\ntheir base camp by the lake. They made it back before \\nthey collapsed from the stingers. But he\\'s not there. \\nMaybe he did save you and had to run.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I\\'m in his \\ndebt again. And this can\\'t be paid back. \"If he did, it \\nwas all probably just part of his act. You know, to \\nmake people think he\\'s in love with me.\" \\n\\n\"Oh,\" says Rue thoughtfully. \"I didn\\'t think that was \\nan act.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n196 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Course it is,\" I say. \"He worked it out with our \\nmentor.\" The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. \\n\"Let\\'s try out these glasses.\" I pull out the glasses and \\nslip them on. Rue wasn\\'t kidding. I can see everything \\nfrom the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling \\nthrough the bushes a good fifty feet away. I could kill \\nit from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone. \\n\\n\"I wonder who else got a pair of these,\" I say. \\n\\n\"The Careers have two pairs. But they\\'ve got \\neverything down by the lake,\" Rue says. \"And they\\'re \\nso strong.\" \\n\\n\"We\\'re strong, too,\" I say. \"Just in a different way.\" \\n\\n\"You are. You can shoot,\" she says. \"What can I do?\" \\n\\n\"You can feed yourself. Can they?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"They don\\'t need to. They have all those supplies,\" \\nRue says. \\n\\n\"Say they didn\\'t. Say the supplies were gone. How \\nlong would they last?\" I say. \"I mean, it\\'s the Hunger \\nGames, right?\" \\n\\n\"But, Katniss, they\\'re not hungry,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\"No, they\\'re not. That\\'s the problem,\" I agree. And for \\nthe first time, I have a plan. A plan that isn\\'t \\nmotivated by the need for flight and evasion. An \\noffensive plan. \"I think we\\'re going to have to fix that, \\nRue.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n197 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nRue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know \\nthis because as soon as the anthem finishes she \\nsnuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I \\nhave any misgivings about her, as I take no particular \\nprecautions. If she\\'d wanted me dead, all she would \\nhave had to do was disappear from that tree without \\npointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling me, at \\nthe very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us \\ncan\\'t win these Games. But since the odds are still \\nagainst either of us surviving, I manage to ignore the \\nthought. \\n\\nBesides, I\\'m distracted by my latest idea about the \\nCareers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must \\nfind a way to destroy their food. I\\'m pretty sure \\nfeeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. \\nTraditionally, the Career tributes\\' strategy is to get \\nhold of all the food early on and work from there. The \\nyears when they have not protected it well \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one year \\na pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a \\nGamemakers\\' flood washed it away \\xe2\\x80\\x94 those are \\nusually the years that tributes from other districts \\nhave won. That the Careers have been better red \\ngrowing up is actually to their disadvantage, because \\nthey don\\'t know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue \\nand I do. \\n\\nBut I\\'m too exhausted to begin any detailed plan \\ntonight. My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit \\nfoggy from the venom, and the warmth of Rue at my \\nside, her head cradled on my shoulder, have given me \\na sense of security. I realize, for the first time, how \\nvery lonely I\\'ve been in the arena. How comforting the \\npresence of another human being can be. I give in to \\nmy drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables \\n198 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nwill turn. Tomorrow, it\\'s the Careers who will have to \\nwatch their backs. \\n\\nThe boom of the cannon jolts me awake. The sky\\'s \\nstreaked with light, the birds already chattering. Rue \\nperches in a branch across from me, her hands \\ncupping something. We wait, listening for more shots, \\nbut there aren\\'t any. \\n\\n\"Who do you think that was?\" I can\\'t help thinking of \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. It could have been any of the \\nothers, \"says Rue. \"I guess well know tonight.\" \\n\\n\"Who\\'s left again?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"The boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. \\nThe boy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and \\nPeeta,\" says Rue. \"That\\'s eight. Wait, and the boy from \\nTen, the one with the bad leg. He makes nine.\" \\n\\nThere\\'s someone else, but neither of us can remember \\nwho it is. \\n\\n\"I wonder how that last one died,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\"No telling. But it\\'s good for us. A death should hold \\nthe crowd for a bit. Maybe well have time to do \\nsomething before the Gamemakers decide things have \\nbeen moving too slowly,\" I say. \"What\\'s in your \\nhands?\" \\n\\n\"Breakfast,\" says Rue. She holds them out revealing \\ntwo big eggs. \\n\\n\"What kind are those?\" I ask. \\n\\n\\n\\n199 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not sure. There\\'s a marshy area over that way. Some \\nkind of waterbird,\" she says. \\n\\nIt\\'d be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to \\nrisk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was \\na victim of the Careers, which means they\\'ve \\nrecovered enough to be back in the Games. We each \\nsuck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and \\nsome berries. It\\'s a good breakfast anywhere. \\n\\n\"Ready to do it?\" I say, pulling on my pack. \\n\\n\"Do what?\" says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, \\nyou can tell she\\'s up for whatever I propose. \\n\\n\"Today we take out the Careers\\' food,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Really? How?\" You can see the glint of excitement in \\nher eyes. In this way, she\\'s exactly the opposite of \\nPrim for whom adventures are an ordeal. \\n\\n\"No idea. Come on, well figure out a plan while we \\nhunt,\" I say. \\n\\nWe don\\'t get much hunting done though because I\\'m \\ntoo busy getting every scrap of information I can out \\nof Rue about the Careers\\' base. She\\'s only been in to \\nspy on them briefly, but she\\'s observant. They have \\nset up their camp beside the lake. Their supply stash \\nis about thirty yards away. During the day, they\\'ve \\nbeen leaving another tribute, the boy from District 3, \\nto watch over the supplies. \\n\\n\"The boy from District Three?\" I ask. \"He\\'s working \\nwith them?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, \\ntoo, when they drew the tracker j ackers in by the \\n\\n\\n\\n200 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nlake,\" says Rue. \"I guess they agreed to let him live if \\nhe acted as their guard. But he\\'s not very big.\" \\n\\n\"What weapons does he have?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not much that I could see. A spear. He might be able \\nto hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill \\nhim easily,\"says Rue. \\n\\n\"And the food\\'s just out in the open?\" I say. She \\nnods. \"Something\\'s not quite right about that whole \\nsetup.\" \\n\\n\"I know. But I couldn\\'t tell what exactly,\" says \\nRue.\"Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how \\nwould you get rid of it?\" \\n\\n\"Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel.\" I poke \\nRue in the belly, just like I would Prim. \"Eat it!\" She \\ngiggles. \"Don\\'t worry, 111 think of something. \\nDestroying things is much easier than making them.\" \\n\\nFor a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and \\ngreens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I \\ncome to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely \\nprotective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the \\nyounger ones, who forages in the meadows in a \\ndistrict where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging \\nthan ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves \\nmost in the world, replies, of all things, \"Music.\" \\n\\n\"Music?\" I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere \\nbetween hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of \\nusefulness. At least a rainbow gives you a tip about \\nthe weather. \"You have a lot of time for that?\" \\n\\n\"We sing at home. At work, too. That\\'s why I love your \\npin,\" she says, pointing to the mockingjay that I\\'ve \\nagain forgotten about. \\n\\n\\n\\n201 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have mocking]\\' ays?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Oh, yes. I have a few that are my special friends. We \\ncan sing back and forth for hours. They carry \\nmessages for me,\" she says. \\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" I say. \\n\\n\"I\\'m usually up highest, so I\\'m the first to see the flag \\nthat signals quitting time. There\\'s a special little song \\nI do,\" says Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a \\nlittle four-note run in a sweet, clear voice. \"And the \\nmockingj ays spread it around the orchard. That\\'s how \\neveryone knows to knock off,\" she continues. \"They \\ncan be dangerous though, if you get too near their \\nnests. But you can\\'t blame them for that.\" \\n\\nI unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. \"Here, you \\ntake it. It has more meaning for you than me.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" says Rue, closing my fingers back over the \\npin. \"I like to see it on you. That\\'s how I decided I \\ncould trust you. Besides, I have this.\" She pulls a \\nnecklace woven out of some kind of grass from her \\nshirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved wooden star. Or \\nmaybe it\\'s a flower. \"It\\'s a good luck charm.\" \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s worked so far,\" I say, pinning the \\nmockingjay back on my shirt. \"Maybe you should just \\nstick with that.\" \\n\\nBy lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are \\npoised to carry it out. I help Rue collect and place the \\nwood for the first two campfires, the third shell have \\ntime for on her own. We decide to meet afterward at \\nthe site where we ate our first meal together. The \\nstream should help guide me back to it. Before I \\nleave, I make sure Rue\\'s well stocked with food and \\n\\n\\n\\n202 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmatches. I even insist she take my sleeping bag, in \\ncase it\\'s not possible to rendezvous by nightfall. \\n\\n\"What about you? Won\\'t you be cold?\" she asks. \\n\\n\"Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake,\" I \\nsay. \"You know, stealing isn\\'t illegal here,\" I say with a \\ngrin. \\n\\nAt the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her \\nmockingj ay signal, the one she gives to indicate the \\nday\\'s work is done. \"It might not work. But if you hear \\nthe mockingjays singing it, youll know I\\'m okay, only \\nI can\\'t get back right away.\" \\n\\n\"Are there many mockingjays here?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Haven\\'t you seen them? They\\'ve got nests \\neverywhere, \"she says. I have to admit I haven\\'t \\nnoticed. \\n\\n\"Okay, then. If all goes according to plan, 111 see you \\nfor dinner,\" I say. \\n\\nUnexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. I only \\nhesitate a moment before I hug her back. \\n\\n\"You be careful,\" she says to me. \\n\\n\"You, too,\" I say. I turn and head back to the stream, \\nfeeling somehow worried. About Rue being killed, \\nabout Rue not being killed and the two of us being left \\nfor last, about leaving Rue alone, about leaving Prim \\nalone back home. No, Prim has my mother and Gale \\nand a baker who has promised she won\\'t go hungry. \\nRue has only me. \\n\\nOnce I reach the stream, I have only to follow it \\ndownhill to the place I initially picked it up after the \\n\\n\\n\\n203 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ntracker jacker attack. I have to be cautious as I move \\nalong the water though, because I find my thoughts \\npreoccupied with unanswered questions, most of \\nwhich concern Peeta. The cannon that fired early this \\nmorning, did that signify his death? If so, how did he \\ndie? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge \\nfor letting me live? I struggle again to remember that \\nmoment over Glimmer\\'s body, when he burst through \\nthe trees. But just the fact that he was sparkling \\nleads me to doubt everything that happened. \\n\\nI must have been moving very slowly yesterday \\nbecause I reach the shallow stretch where I took my \\nbath in just a few hours. I stop to replenish my water \\nand add a layer of mud to my backpack. It seems \\nbent on reverting to orange no matter how many \\ntimes I cover it. \\n\\nMy proximity to the Careers\\' camp sharpens my \\nsenses, and the closer I get to them, the more \\nguarded I am, pausing frequently to listen for \\nunnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted into the \\nstring of my bow. I don\\'t see any other tributes, but I \\ndo notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. \\nPatches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves \\nthat healed my stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests \\nin the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in. And here \\nand there, the black-and-white flash of a mockingjay \\nwing in the branches high over my head. \\n\\nWhen I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the \\nfoot, I pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue \\nhas given specific instructions on how to reach the \\nbest spying place near the lake from this point. \\nRemember, I tell myself. You\\'re the hunter now, not \\nthem. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I \\nmake it to the copse Rue has told me about and again \\nhave to admire her cleverness. It\\'s right at the edge of \\nthe wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I \\n204 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncan easily observe the Career camp without being \\nspotted. Between us lies the flat expanse where the \\nGames began. \\n\\nThere are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato \\nand the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen- \\nskinned boy who must be from District 3. He made \\nalmost no impression on me at all during our time in \\nthe Capitol. I can remember almost nothing about \\nhim, not his costume, not his training score, not his \\ninterview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling with \\nsome kind of plastic box, he\\'s easily ignored in the \\npresence of his large and domineering companions. \\nBut he must be of some value or they wouldn\\'t have \\nbothered to let him live. Still, seeing him only adds to \\nmy sense of unease over why the Careers would \\npossibly leave him as a guard, why they have allowed \\nhim to live at all. \\n\\nAll four tributes seem to still be recovering from the \\ntracker jacker attack. Even from here, I can see the \\nlarge swollen lumps on their bodies. They must not \\nhave had the sense to remove the stingers, or if they \\ndid, not known about the leaves that healed them. \\nApparently, whatever medicines they found in the \\nCornucopia have been ineffective. \\n\\nThe Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its \\ninsides have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, \\nheld in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are \\npiled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a \\nquestionable distance from the camp. Others are \\nsprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, \\nalmost mimicking the layout of supplies around the \\nCornucopia at the onset of the Games. A canopy of \\nnetting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to \\nbe useless shelters the pyramid itself. \\n\\n\\n\\n205 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole setup is completely perplexing. The \\ndistance, the netting, and the presence of the boy \\nfrom District 3. One thing\\'s for sure, destroying those \\nsupplies is not going to be as simple as it looks. Some \\nother factor is at play here, and I\\'d better stay put \\nuntil I figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid \\nis booby-trapped in some manner. I think of \\nconcealed pits, descending nets, a thread that when \\nbroken sends a poisonous dart into your heart. \\nReally, the possibilities are endless. \\n\\nWhile I am mulling over my options, I hear Cato shout \\nout. He\\'s pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, \\nand without turning I know that Rue must have set \\nthe first campfire. We\\'d made sure to gather enough \\ngreen wood to make the smoke noticeable. The \\nCareers begin to arm themselves at once. \\n\\nAn argument breaks out. It\\'s loud enough for me to \\nhear that it concerns whether or not the boy from \\nDistrict 3 should stay or accompany them. \\n\\n\"He\\'s coming. We need him in the woods, and his \\njob\\'s done here anyway. No one can touch those \\nsupplies,\" says Cato. \\n\\n\"What about Lover Boy?\" says the boy from District 1 . \\n\\n\"I keep telling you, forget about him. I know where I \\ncut him. It\\'s a miracle he hasn\\'t bled to death yet. At \\nany rate, he\\'s in no shape to raid us,\" says Cato. \\n\\nSo Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. \\nBut I am still in the dark on what motivated him to \\nbetray the Careers. \\n\\n\"Come on,\" says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the \\nhands of the boy from District 3, and they head off in \\nthe direction of the fire. The last thing I hear as they \\n\\n\\n\\n206 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nenter the woods is Cato saying, \"When we find her, I \\nkill her in my own way, and no one interferes.\" \\n\\nSomehow I don\\'t think he\\'s talking about Rue. She \\ndidn\\'t drop a nest of tracker jackers on him. \\n\\nI stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out \\nwhat to do about the supplies. The one advantage I \\nhave with the bow and arrow is distance. I could send \\na flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\'m \\na good enough shot to get it through those openings \\nin the net \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but there\\'s no guarantee it would catch. \\nMore likely it\\'d just burn itself out and then what? I\\'d \\nhave achieved nothing and given them far too much \\ninformation about myself. That I was here, that I have \\nan accomplice, that I can use the bow and arrow with \\naccuracy. \\n\\nThere\\'s no alternative. I\\'m going to have to get in \\ncloser and see if I can\\'t discover what exactly protects \\nthe supplies. In fact, I\\'m just about to reveal myself \\nwhen a movement catches my eye. Several hundred \\nyards to my right, I see someone emerge from the \\nwoods. For a second, I think it\\'s Rue, but then I \\nrecognize Foxface \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she\\'s the one we couldn\\'t \\nremember this morning \\xe2\\x80\\x94 creeping out onto the plain. \\nWhen she decides it\\'s safe, she runs for the pyramid, \\nwith quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the \\ncircle of supplies that have been littered around the \\npyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and \\ncarefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to \\napproach the pyramid with strange little hops, \\nsometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, \\nsometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she \\nlaunches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands \\npoised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and \\nher momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a \\nsharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but \\nnothing happens. In a moment, she\\'s regained her \\n207 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfeet and continues until she has reached the bulk of \\nthe supplies. \\n\\nSo, I\\'m right about the booby trap, but it\\'s clearly \\nmore complex than I had imagined. I was right about \\nthe girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this \\npath into the food and to be able to replicate it so \\nneatly? She fills her pack, taking a few items from a \\nvariety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful \\nof apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended \\nfrom a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful \\nfrom each, not enough to tip off that the food is \\nmissing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then \\nshe\\'s doing her odd little dance back out of the circle \\nand scampering into the woods again, safe and \\nsound. \\n\\nI realize I\\'m grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface \\nhas confirmed what I\\'d already guessed. But what \\nsort of trap have they laid that requires such \\ndexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she \\nsqueal so as her hands made contact with the earth? \\nYou\\'d have thought ... and slowly it begins to dawn on \\nme ... you\\'d have thought the very ground was going \\nto explode. \\n\\n\"It\\'s mined,\" I whisper. That explains everything. The \\nCareers\\' willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface\\'s \\nreaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, \\nwhere they have the factories, where they make \\ntelevisions and automobiles and explosives. But \\nwhere did he get them? In the supplies? That\\'s not \\nthe sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, \\ngiven that they like to see the tributes draw blood \\npersonally. I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of \\nthe round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the \\narena. The ground around it has been dug up and \\npatted back down. The land mines were disabled after \\nthe sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy \\n208 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom District 3 must have managed to reactivate \\nthem. I\\'ve never seen anyone in the Games do that. I \\nbet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers. \\n\\nWell, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting \\none over on them, but what am I supposed to do \\nnow? Obviously, I can\\'t go strolling into that mess \\nwithout blowing myself sky-high. As for sending in a \\nburning arrow, that\\'s more laughable than ever. The \\nmines are set off by pressure. It doesn\\'t have to be a \\nlot, either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small \\nwooden ball, while she was at her plate, and they \\nliterally had to scrape bits of her off the ground. \\n\\nMy arm\\'s pretty good, I might be able to chuck some \\nrocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? \\nThat could start a chain reaction. Or could it? Would \\nthe boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such \\na way that a single mine would not disturb the \\nothers? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring \\nthe death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one \\nmine, I\\'d draw the Careers back down on me for sure. \\nAnd anyway, what am I thinking? There\\'s that net, \\nclearly strung to deflect any such attack. Besides, \\nwhat I\\'d really need is to throw about thirty rocks in \\nthere at once, setting off a big chain reaction, \\ndemolishing the whole lot. \\n\\nI glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rue\\'s \\nsecond fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the \\nCareers have probably begun to suspect some sort of \\ntrick. Time is running out. \\n\\nThere is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can \\nonly focus hard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the \\nbins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an \\narrow. Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the \\nburning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could \\nend up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a \\n209 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndirect hit on an oil bin, since I\\'d just be guessing. I\\'m \\ngenuinely thinking of trying to re-create Foxface\\'s trip \\nup to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of \\ndestruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of \\napples. I could sever the rope in one shot, didn\\'t I do \\nas much in the Training Center? It\\'s a big bag, but it \\nstill might only be good for one explosion. If only I \\ncould free the apples themselves ... \\n\\nI know what to do. I move into range and give myself \\nthree arrows to get the job done. I place my feet \\ncarefully, block out the rest of the world as I take \\nmeticulous aim, The first arrow tears through the side \\nof the bag near the top, leaving a split in the burlap. \\nThe second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the \\nfirst apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, \\ncatching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from \\nthe bag. \\n\\nFor a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then \\nthe apples spill to the ground and I\\'m blown \\nbackward into the air. \\n\\n\\n\\n210 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain \\nknocks the wind out of me. My backpack does little to \\nsoften the blow. Fortunately my quiver has caught in \\nthe crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my \\nshoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp. The \\nground still shakes with explosions. I can\\'t hear them. \\nI can\\'t hear anything at the moment. But the apples \\nmust have set off enough mines, causing debris to \\nactivate the others. I manage to shield my face with \\nmy arms as shattered bits of matter, some of it \\nburning, rain down around me. An acrid smoke fills \\nthe air, which is not the best remedy for someone \\ntrying to regain the ability to breathe. \\n\\nAfter about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I \\nroll on my side and allow myself a moment of \\nsatisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that \\nwas recently the pyramid. The Careers aren\\'t likely to \\nsalvage anything out of that. \\n\\nI\\'d better get out of here, I think. They \\'11 be making a \\nbeeline for the place. But once I\\'m on my feet, I realize \\nescape may not be so simple. I\\'m dizzy. Not the \\nslightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the \\ntrees swooping around you and causes the earth to \\nmove in waves under your feet. \\n\\nI take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands \\nand knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it \\ndoesn\\'t. \\n\\nPanic begins to set in. I can\\'t stay here. Flight is \\nessential. But I can neither walk nor hear. I place a \\nhand to my left ear, the one that was turned toward \\nthe blast, and it comes away bloody. Have I gone deaf \\n211 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the explosion? The idea frightens me. I rely as \\nmuch on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe \\nmore at times. But I can\\'t let my fear show. \\nAbsolutely, positively, I am live on every screen in \\nPanem. \\n\\nNo blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my \\nhood up over my head, tie the cord under my chin \\nwith uncooperative fingers. That should help soak up \\nthe blood. I can\\'t walk, but can I crawl? I move \\nforward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly, I can \\ncrawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. \\nMy only hope is to make it back to Rue\\'s copse and \\nconceal myself in greenery. I can\\'t get caught out here \\non my hands and knees in the open. Not only will I \\nface death, it\\'s sure to be a long and painful one at \\nCato\\'s hand. The thought of Prim having to watch \\nthat keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the \\nhideout. \\n\\nAnother blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray \\nmine, set off by some collapsing crate. This happens \\ntwice more. I\\'m reminded of those last few kernels \\nthat burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at \\nhome. \\n\\nTo say I make it in the nick of time is an \\nunderstatement. I have literally just dragged myself \\ninto the tangle of hushes at the base of the trees \\nwhen there\\'s Cato, barreling onto the plain, soon \\nfollowed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it \\nmight be comical \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so people really do tear out their \\nhair and beat the ground with their fists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if I didn\\'t \\nknow that it was aimed at me, at what I have done to \\nhim. Add to that my proximity, my inability to run or \\ndefend myself, and in fact, the whole thing has me \\nterrified. I\\'m glad my hiding place makes it impossible \\nfor the cameras to get a close shot of me because I\\'m \\nbiting my nails like there\\'s no tomorrow. Gnawing off \\n212 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth \\nfrom chattering. \\n\\nThe boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins \\nand must have declared all the mines activated \\nbecause the Careers are approaching the wreckage. \\n\\nCato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and \\ntakes out his anger on the smoking remains by \\nkicking open various containers. The other tributes \\nare poking around in the mess, looking for anything \\nto salvage, but there\\'s nothing. The boy from District \\n3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur to \\nCato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears \\nto be shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only \\nhas time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a \\nheadlock from behind. I can see the muscles ripple in \\nCato\\'s arms as he sharply jerks the boy\\'s head to the \\nside. \\n\\nIt\\'s that quick. The death of the boy from District 3. \\n\\nThe other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato \\ndown. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but \\nthey keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until \\nI realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the \\nexplosions is dead. \\n\\nThey don\\'t know about the arrows and the apples. \\nThey assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the \\ntribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If \\nthere was a cannon shot, it could have been easily \\nlost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered \\nremains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They \\nretire to the far side of the lake to allow the \\nGamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from \\nDistrict 3. And they wait. \\n\\n\\n\\n213 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and \\ntakes the dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. \\nNight falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the \\nanthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. \\nThey show the boy from District 3. They show the boy \\nfrom District 10, who must have died this morning. \\nThen the seal reappears. So, now they know. The \\nbomber survived. In the seal\\'s light, I can see Cato \\nand the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision \\nglasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a tree branch \\nfor a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all \\ntheir faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to \\nhunt. \\n\\nThe dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is \\nstill deafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which \\nseems a good sign. There\\'s no point in leaving my \\nhiding place, though. I\\'m about as safe as I can be, \\nhere at the crime scene. They probably think the \\nbomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. Still \\nit\\'s a long time before I risk moving. \\n\\nThe first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put \\nthem on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least \\none of my hunter\\'s senses working. I drink some \\nwater and wash the blood from my ear. Fearing the \\nsmell of meat will draw unwanted predators \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fresh \\nblood is bad enough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I make a good meal out of the \\ngreens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered \\ntoday. \\n\\nWhere is my little ally? Did she make it back to the \\nrendezvous point? Is she worried about me? At least, \\nthe sky has shown we\\'re both alive. \\n\\nI run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. \\nThe boy from 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 1 1 \\nand 12. Just eight of us. The betting must be getting \\nreally hot in the Capitol. They\\'ll be doing special \\n214 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfeatures on each of us now. Probably interviewing our \\nfriends and families. It\\'s been a long time since a \\ntribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. \\nAnd now there are two of us. Although from what \\nCato said, Peeta\\'s on his way out. Not that Cato is the \\nfinal word on anything. Didn\\'t he just lose his entire \\nstash of supplies? \\n\\nLet the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I \\nthink. Let them begin for real. \\n\\nA cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping \\nbag before I remember I left it with Rue. I was \\nsupposed to pick up another one, but what with the \\nmines and all, I forgot. I begin to shiver. Since \\nroosting overnight in a tree isn\\'t sensible anyway, I \\nscoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover \\nmyself with leaves and pine needles. I\\'m still freezing. \\nI lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and \\nposition my backpack to block the wind. It\\'s a little \\nbetter. I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from \\nDistrict 8 that lit the fire that first night. But now it\\'s \\nme who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until \\nmorning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my \\narms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my \\nchest. Somehow, I drift off to sleep. \\n\\nWhen I open my eyes, the world looks slightly \\nfractured, and it takes a minute to realize that the \\nsun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my \\nvision. As I sit up and remove them, I hear a laugh \\nsomewhere near the lake and freeze. The laugh\\'s \\ndistorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I \\nmust be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can \\nhear again, although it\\'s still ringing. As for my left \\near, well, at least the bleeding has stopped. \\n\\nI peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have \\nreturned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, \\n215 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nit\\'s Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid \\nand laughing. She\\'s smarter than the Careers, \\nactually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A \\nmetal pot. A knife blade. I\\'m perplexed by her \\namusement until I realize that with the Careers\\' \\nstores eliminated, she might actually stand a chance. \\nJust like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal \\nmyself and enlist her as a second ally against that \\npack. But I rule it out. There\\'s something about that \\nsly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface \\nwould ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that \\nin mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. \\nBut she\\'s heard something, not me, because her head \\nturns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for \\nthe woods. I wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if \\nFoxface thought it was dangerous, maybe it\\'s time for \\nme to get out of here, too. Besides, I\\'m eager to tell \\nRue about the pyramid. \\n\\nSince I\\'ve no idea where the Careers are, the route \\nback by the stream seems as good as any. I hurry, \\nloaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold groosling in \\nthe other, because I\\'m famished now, and not just for \\nleaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the \\nmeat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once \\nthere, I refill my water and wash, taking particular \\ncare with my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using \\nthe stream as a guide. At one point, I find boot prints \\nin the mud along the bank. The Careers have been \\nhere, but not for a while. The prints are deep because \\nthey were made in soft mud, but now they\\'re nearly \\ndry in the hot sun. I haven\\'t been careful enough \\nabout my own tracks, counting on a light tread and \\nthe pine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off \\nmy boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the \\nstream. \\n\\nThe cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, \\nmy spirits. I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow- \\n216 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmoving stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even \\nthough I\\'ve just had the groosling. The second I\\'ll save \\nfor Rue. \\n\\nGradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear \\ndiminishes until it\\'s gone entirely. I find myself \\npawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean \\naway whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds. If \\nthere\\'s improvement, it\\'s undetectable. I can\\'t adjust \\nto deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced \\nand defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps \\nturning to the injured side, as my right ear tries to \\ncompensate for the wall of nothingness where \\nyesterday there was a constant flow of information. \\nThe more time that passes, the less hopeful I am that \\nthis is an injury that will heal. \\n\\nWhen I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel \\ncertain it\\'s been undisturbed. There\\'s no sign of Rue, \\nnot on the ground or in the trees. This is odd. By now \\nshe should have returned, as it\\'s midday. \\nUndoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree \\nsomewhere. What else could she do with no light and \\nthe Careers with their night-vision glasses tramping \\naround the woods. And the third fire she was \\nsupposed to set \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although I forgot to check for it \\nlast night \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was the farthest from our site of all. \\nShe\\'s probably just being cautious about making her \\nway back. I wish she\\'d hurry, because I don\\'t want to \\nhang around here too long. I want to spend the \\nafternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we \\ngo. But there\\'s nothing really for me to do but wait. \\n\\nI wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean \\nmy ever-growing list of wounds. The burns are much \\nbetter but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway. \\nThe main thing to worry about now is keeping out \\ninfection. I go ahead and eat the second fish. It isn\\'t \\ngoing to last long in this hot sun, but it should be \\n217 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\neasy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she would \\njust show up. \\n\\nFeeling too vulnerable on the ground with my \\nlopsided hearing, I scale a tree to wait. If the Careers \\nshow up, this will be a fine place to shoot them from. \\nThe sun moves slowly. I do things to pass the time. \\nChew leaves and apply them to my stings that are \\ndeflated but still tender. Comb through my damp hair \\nwith my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back up. \\nCheck over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test \\nmy left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf \\nnear it, but without good results. \\n\\nDespite the groosling and the fish, my stomach\\'s \\ngrowling, and I know I\\'m going to have what we call a \\nhollow day back in District 12. That\\'s a day where no \\nmatter what you put in your belly, it\\'s never enough. \\nHaving nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse, \\nso I decide to give into it. After all, I\\'ve lost a lot of \\nweight in the arena, I need some extra calories. And \\nhaving the bow and arrows makes me far more \\nconfident about my future prospects. \\n\\nI slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last \\ncracker. The groosling neck. That\\'s good because it \\ntakes time to pick clean. Finally, a groosling wing and \\nthe bird is history. But it\\'s a hollow day, and even \\nwith all that I start daydreaming about food. \\nParticularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. \\nThe chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and \\npudding. Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. \\nThe lamb and dried plum stew. I suck on a few mint \\nleaves and tell myself to get over it. Mint is good \\nbecause we drink mint tea after supper often, so it \\ntricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. \\nSort of. \\n\\n\\n\\n218 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nDangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a \\nmouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand . . . this \\nis the most relaxed I\\'ve been since I\\'ve entered the \\narena. If only Rue would show up, and we could clear \\nout. As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. \\nBy late afternoon, I\\'ve resolved to go looking for her. I \\ncan at least visit the spot where she set the third fire \\nand see if there are any clues to her whereabouts. \\n\\nBefore I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old \\ncamp fire. Since we gathered these some distance \\naway, Rue will understand I\\'ve been here, while they\\'ll \\nmean nothing to the Careers. \\n\\nIn less than an hour, I\\'m at the place where we agreed \\nto have the third fire and I know something has gone \\namiss. The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly \\ninterspersed with tinder, but it has never been lit. \\nRue set up the fire but never made it back here. \\nSomewhere between the second column of smoke I \\nspied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she \\nran into trouble. \\n\\nI have to remind myself she\\'s still alive. Or is she? \\nCould the cannon shot announcing her death have \\ncome in the wee hours of the morning when even my \\ngood ear was too broken to pick it up? Will she \\nappear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to believe it. \\nThere could be a hundred other explanations. She \\ncould have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators \\nor another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. \\nWhatever happened, I\\'m almost certain she\\'s stuck \\nout there, somewhere between the second fire and the \\nunlit one at my feet. Something is keeping her up a \\ntree. \\n\\nI think I\\'ll go hunt it down. \\n\\n\\n\\n219 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a relief to be doing something after sitting around \\nall afternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, \\nletting them conceal me. But nothing seems \\nsuspicious. There\\'s no sign of any kind of struggle, no \\ndisruption of the needles on the ground. I\\'ve stopped \\nfor just a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my \\nhead around to the side to be sure, but there it is \\nagain. Rue\\'s four-note tune coming out of a \\nmockingj ay\\'s mouth. The one that means she\\'s all \\nright. \\n\\nI grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another \\njust a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful \\nof notes. Rue has been singing to them, and recently. \\nOtherwise they\\'d have taken up some other song. My \\neyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of her. I \\nswallow and sing softly back, hoping she\\'ll know it\\'s \\nsafe to join me. A mockingj ay repeats the melody to \\nme. And that\\'s when I hear the scream. \\n\\nIt\\'s a child\\'s scream, a young girl\\'s scream, there\\'s no \\none in the arena capable of making that sound except \\nRue. And now I\\'m running, knowing this may be a \\ntrap, knowing the three Careers may be poised to \\nattack me, but I can\\'t help myself. There\\'s another \\nhigh-pitched cry, this time my name. \"Katniss! \\nKatniss!\" \\n\\n\"Rue!\" I shout back, so she knows I\\'m near. So, they \\nknow I\\'m near, and hopefully the girl who has \\nattacked them with tracker j ackers and gotten an \\neleven they still can\\'t explain will be enough to pull \\ntheir attention away from her. \"Rue! I\\'m coming!\" \\n\\nWhen I break into the clearing, she\\'s on the ground, \\nhopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to \\nreach her hand through the mesh and say my name \\nbefore the spear enters her body. \\n\\n\\n\\n220 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the \\nspear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his \\nneck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief \\nremainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and \\ndrowning in his own blood. I\\'m reloaded, shifting my \\naim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, \"Are there \\nmore? Are there more?\" \\n\\nShe has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue \\nhas rolled to her side, her body curved in and around \\nthe spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out \\nmy knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the \\nwound and I know it\\'s far beyond my capacity to heal, \\nbeyond anyone\\'s probably. The spearhead is buried \\nup to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, \\nstaring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There\\'s \\nno point in comforting words, in telling her she\\'ll be \\nall right. She\\'s no fool. Her hand reaches out and I \\nclutch it like a lifeline. As if it\\'s me who\\'s dying \\ninstead of Rue. \\n\\n\"You blew up the food?\" she whispers. \\n\\n\"Every last bit,\" I say. \\n\\n\"You have to win,\" she says. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to. Going to win for both of us now,\" I \\npromise. I hear a cannon and look up. It must be for \\nthe boy from District 1 . \\n\\n\"Don\\'t go.\" Rue tightens her grip on my hand. \\n\\n\\n\\n221 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Course not. Staying right here,\" I say. I move in \\ncloser to her, pulling her head onto my lap. I gently \\nbrush the dark, thick hair back behind her ear. \\n\\n\"Sing,\" she says, but I barely catch the word. \\n\\nSing? I think. Sing what?I do know a few songs. \\nBelieve it or not, there was once music in my house, \\ntoo. Music I helped make. My father pulled me in with \\nthat remarkable voice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but I haven\\'t sung much \\nsince he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then I \\nsing her the same songs she liked as a baby. \\n\\nSing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke \\nand fatigue. But if this is Prim\\'s, I mean, Rue\\'s last \\nrequest, I have to at least try. The song that comes to \\nme is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry \\nbabies to sleep with, It\\'s old, very old I think. Made up \\nlong ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a \\nmountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, \\npromising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this \\nawful piece of time we call today. \\n\\nI give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin: \\n\\nDeep in the meadow, under the willow \\n\\nA bed of grass, a soft green pillow \\n\\nLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyes \\n\\nAnd when again they open, the sun will rise. \\n\\nHere it\\'s safe, here it\\'s warm \\n\\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm \\n\\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings \\nthem true \\n\\n\\n\\n222 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the place where I love you. \\n\\nRue\\'s eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but \\nonly slightly. My throat releases the tears and they \\nslide down my cheeks. But I have to finish the song \\nfor her. \\n\\nDeep in the meadow, hidden far away \\n\\nA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray \\n\\nForget your woes and let your troubles lay \\n\\nAnd when again it\\'s morning, they\\'ll wash away. \\n\\nHere it\\'s safe, here it\\'s warm \\n\\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm \\n\\nThe final lines are barely audible. \\n\\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings \\nthem true \\n\\nHere is the place where I love you. \\n\\nEverything\\'s still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the \\nmockingj ays take up my song. \\n\\nFor a moment, I sit there, watching my tears drip \\ndown on her face. Rue\\'s cannon fires. I lean forward \\nand press my lips against her temple. Slowly, as if not \\nto wake her, I lay her head back on the ground and \\nrelease her hand. \\n\\nThey\\'ll want me to clear out now. So they can collect \\nthe bodies. And there\\'s nothing to stay for. I roll the \\nboy from District 1 onto his face and take his pack, \\nretrieve the arrow that ended his life. I cut Rue\\'s pack \\n\\n\\n\\n223 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom her back as well, knowing she\\'d want me to have \\nit but leave the spear in her stomach. Weapons in \\nbodies will be transported to the hovercraft. I\\'ve no \\nuse for a spear, so the sooner it\\'s gone from the arena \\nthe better. \\n\\nI can\\'t stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby \\nanimal curled up in a nest of netting. I can\\'t bring \\nmyself to leave her like this. Past harm, but seeming \\nutterly defenseless. To hate the boy from District 1, \\nwho also appears so vulnerable in death, seems \\ninadequate. It\\'s the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all \\nof us. \\n\\nGale\\'s voice is in my head. His ravings against the \\nCapitol no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. \\nRue\\'s death has forced me to confront my own fury \\nagainst the cruelty, the injustice they inflict upon us. \\nBut here, even more strongly than at home, I feel my \\nimpotence. There\\'s no way to take revenge on the \\nCapitol. Is there? \\n\\nThen I remember Peeta\\'s words on the roof. \"Only I \\nkeep wishing I could think of a way to ... to show the \\nCapital they don\\'t own me. That I\\'m more than just a \\npiece in their Games.\" And for the first time, I \\nunderstand what he means. \\n\\nI want to do something, right here, right now, to \\nshame them, to make them accountable, to show the \\nCapitol that whatever they do or force us to do there \\nis a part of every tribute they can\\'t own. That Rue was \\nmore than a piece in their Games. And so am I. \\n\\nA few steps into the woods grows a bank of \\nwildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some \\nsort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of \\nviolet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful \\nand come back to Rue\\'s side. Slowly, one stem at a \\n224 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ntime, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the \\nugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair \\nwith bright colors. \\n\\nThey\\'ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn \\nthe cameras elsewhere at this moment, theyll have to \\nbring them back when they collect the bodies and \\neveryone will see her then and know I did it. I step \\nback and take a last look at Rue. She could really be \\nasleep in that meadow after all. \\n\\n\"Bye, Rue,\" I whisper. I press the three middle fingers \\nof my left hand against my lips and hold them out in \\nher direction. Then I walk away without looking back. \\n\\nThe birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives \\nthe warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I \\ndon\\'t know how it knows. It must hear things that \\nhumans can\\'t. I pause, my eyes focused on what\\'s \\nahead, not what\\'s happening behind me. It doesn\\'t \\ntake long, then the general birdsong begins again and \\nI know she\\'s gone. \\n\\nAnother mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, \\nlands on a branch before me and bursts out Rue\\'s \\nmelody. \\n\\nMy song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this \\nnovice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of \\nnotes. The ones that mean she\\'s safe. \\n\\n\"Good and safe,\" I say as I pass under its branch. \"We \\ndon\\'t have to worry about her now.\" Good and safe. \\n\\nI\\'ve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had \\nthat one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander \\nthis way and that until sunset. I\\'m not afraid, not \\neven watchful. Which makes me an easy target. \\nExcept I\\'d kill anyone I met on sight. Without emotion \\n225 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nor the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred of the \\nCapitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors \\nin the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, \\ncan be made to pay for Rue\\'s death. \\n\\nNo one materializes though. There aren\\'t many of us \\nleft and it\\'s a big arena. Soon they\\'ll be pulling out \\nsome other device to force us together. But there\\'s \\nbeen enough gore today. Perhaps we\\'ll even get to \\nsleep. \\n\\nI\\'m about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp \\nwhen a silver parachute floats down and lands in \\nfront of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now? I\\'ve \\nbeen in fairly good shape with supplies. Maybe \\nHaymitch\\'s noticed my despondency and is trying to \\ncheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to help \\nmy ear? \\n\\nI open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread \\nIt\\'s not the fine white Capitol stuff. It\\'s made of dark \\nration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with \\nseeds. I flash back to Peeta\\'s lesson on the various \\ndistrict breads in the Training Center. This bread \\ncame from District 1 1 . I cautiously lift the still warm \\nloaf. What must it have cost the people of District 1 1 \\nwho can\\'t even feed themselves? How many would Ve \\nhad to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the \\ncollection for this one loaf? It had been meant for \\nRue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she \\ndied, they\\'d authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a \\nthank-you? Or because, like me, they don\\'t like to let \\ndebts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. \\nA district gift to a tribute who\\'s not your own. \\n\\nI lift my face and step into the last falling rays of \\nsunlight. \"My thanks to the people of District Eleven,\" \\nI say. I want them to know I know where it came \\n\\n\\n\\n226 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom. That the full value of their gift has been \\nrecognized. \\n\\nI climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but \\nto get as far away from today as I can. My sleeping \\nbag is rolled neatly in Rue\\'s pack. Tomorrow I\\'ll sort \\nthrough the supplies. Tomorrow I\\'ll make a new plan. \\nBut tonight, all I can do is strap myself in and take \\ntiny bites of the bread. It\\'s good. It tastes of home. \\n\\nSoon the seal\\'s in the sky, the anthem plays in my \\nright ear. I see the boy from District 1, Rue. That\\'s all \\nfor tonight. Six of us left, I think. Only six. With the \\nbread still locked in my hands, I fall asleep at once. \\n\\nSometimes when things are particularly bad, my \\nbrain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my \\nfather in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake \\nwith Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in \\nher flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to \\nteach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of \\nher wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She \\nsings songs I\\'ve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. \\nOn and on. Through the night. There\\'s a drowsy in- \\nbetween period when I can hear the last few strains of \\nher music although she\\'s lost in the leaves. When I \\nfully awaken, I\\'m momentarily comforted. I try to hold \\non to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly \\nslips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever. \\n\\nHeaviness infuses my whole body, as if there\\'s liquid \\nlead in my veins. I\\'ve lost the will to do the simplest \\ntasks, to do anything but lie here, staring \\nunblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For \\nseveral hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it\\'s the \\nthought of Prim\\'s anxious face as she watches me on \\nthe screens back home that breaks me from my \\nlethargy. \\n\\n\\n\\n227 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI give myself a series of simple commands to follow, \\nlike \"Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have \\nto drink water, Katniss.\" I act on the orders with slow, \\nrobotic motions. \"Now you have to sort the packs, \\nKatniss.\" \\n\\nRue\\'s pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty \\nwater skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of \\nrabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy \\nfrom District 1 has several knives, two spare \\nspearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a \\nfirst-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried \\nfruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have \\nchosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme \\narrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have \\nsuch a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your \\nenemies so quickly you\\'ll be home before you\\'re \\nhungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so \\nlightly when it came to food and now find themselves \\nwith nothing. \\n\\nSpeaking of which, my own supply is running low. I \\nfinish off the loaf from District 1 1 and the last of the \\nrabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left \\nare Rue\\'s roots and nuts, the boy\\'s dried fruit, and \\none strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss, I tell \\nmyself. \\n\\nI obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my \\npack. After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy\\'s \\nknives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no \\none else can use them. I\\'ve lost my bearings what \\nwith all the wandering around I did yesterday \\nevening, but I try and head back in the general \\ndirection of the stream. I know I\\'m on course when I \\ncome across Rue\\'s third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, \\nI discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees \\nand take out three before they know what hit them. I \\nreturn to Rue\\'s signal fire and start it up, not caring \\n228 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nabout the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato? I \\nthink as I roast the birds and Rue\\'s roots. I\\'m waiting \\nright here. \\n\\nWho knows where the Careers are now? Either too far \\nto reach me or too sure this is a trick or ... is it \\npossible? Too scared of me? They know I have the \\nbow and arrows, of course, Cato saw me take them \\nfrom Glimmer\\'s body, but have they put two and two \\ntogether yet? Figured out I blew up the supplies and \\nkilled their fellow Career? Possibly they think Thresh \\ndid this. Wouldn\\'t he be more likely to revenge Rue\\'s \\ndeath than I would? Being from the same district? Not \\nthat he ever took any interest in her. \\n\\nAnd what about Foxface? Did she hang around to \\nwatch me blow up the supplies? No. When I caught \\nher laughing in the ashes the next morning, it was as \\nif someone had given her a lovely surprise. \\n\\nI doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Cato\\'s \\nsure he\\'s as good as dead. I find myself wishing I \\ncould tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue. That I \\nnow understand what he was trying to say on the \\nroof. Perhaps if he wins the Games, he\\'ll see me on \\nvictor\\'s night, when they replay the highlights of the \\nGames on a screen over the stage where we did our \\ninterviews. The winner sits in a place of honor on the \\nplatform, surrounded by their support crew. \\n\\nBut I told Rue I\\'d be there. For both of us. And \\nsomehow that seems even more important than the \\nvow I gave Prim. \\n\\nI really think I stand a chance of doing it now. \\nWinning. It\\'s not just having the arrows or \\noutsmarting the Careers a few times, although those \\nthings help. Something happened when I was holding \\nRue\\'s hand, watching the life drain out of her. Now I \\n229 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nam determined to revenge her, to make her loss \\nunforgettable, and I can only do that by winning and \\nthereby making myself unforgettable. \\n\\nI overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to \\nshoot, but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are \\nout there beating one another senseless. Which would \\nbe fine, Ever since the bloodbath, I\\'ve been featured \\non screens most than I care. \\n\\nEventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the \\nstream to replenish my water and gather some. But \\nthe heaviness from the morning drapes back over me \\nand even though it\\'s only early evening, I climb a tree \\nand settle in for the night. My brain begins to replay \\nthe events from yesterday. I keep seeing Rue speared, \\nmy arrow piercing the boy\\'s neck. I don\\'t know why I \\nshould even care about the boy. \\n\\nThen I realize ... he was my first kill. \\n\\nAlong with other statistics they report to help people \\nplace their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I \\nguess technically I\\'d get credited for Glimmer and the \\ngirl from District 4, too, for dumping that nest on \\nthem. But the boy from District 1 was the first person \\nI knew would die because of my actions. Numerous \\nanimals have lost their lives at my hands, but only \\none human. I hear Gale saying, \"How different can it \\nbe, really?\" \\n\\nAmazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an \\narrow shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed \\na boy whose name I don\\'t even know. Somewhere his \\nfamily is weeping for him. His friends call for my \\nblood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed \\nhe would come back . . . \\n\\n\\n\\n230 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nBut then I think of Rue\\'s still body and I\\'m able to \\nbanish the boy from my mind. At least, for now. \\n\\nIt\\'s been an uneventful day according to the sky. No \\ndeaths. I wonder how long well get until the next \\ncatastrophe drives us back together. If it\\'s going to be \\ntonight, I want to get some sleep first. I cover my good \\near to block out the strains of the anthem, but then I \\nhear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation. \\n\\nFor the most part, the only communication the \\ntributes get from outside the arena is the nightly \\ndeath toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets \\nfollowed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a \\ncall to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers \\nwill invite the players to a banquet, somewhere \\nknown to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement \\nto gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and \\nsometimes there\\'s nothing but a loaf of stale bread for \\nthe tributes to compete for. I wouldn\\'t go in for the \\nfood, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few \\ncompetitors. \\n\\nClaudius Templesmith\\'s voice booms down from \\noverhead, congratulating the six of us who remain. \\nBut he is not inviting us to a feast. He\\'s saying \\nsomething very confusing. There\\'s been a rule change \\nin the Games. A rule change! That in itself is mind \\nbending since we don\\'t really have any rules to speak \\nof except don\\'t step off your circle for sixty seconds \\nand the unspoken rule about not eating one another. \\nUnder the new rule, both tributes from the same \\ndistrict will be declared winners if they are the last \\ntwo alive. Claudius pauses, as if he knows we\\'re not \\ngetting it, and repeats the change again. \\n\\nThe news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If \\nthey\\'re from the same district. Both can live. Both of \\nus can live. \\n\\n\\n\\n231 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore I can stop myself, I call out Peeta\\'s name. \\n\\n\\n\\n232 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPART III \\n\"THE VICTOR\" \\n\\n\\n\\n233 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has \\nalready escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a \\nchorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! I tell \\nmyself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, frozen, for \\nthe woods to come alive with assailants. Then I \\nremember there\\'s almost no one left. \\n\\nPeeta, who\\'s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever \\ndoubts I\\'ve had about him dissipate because if either \\nof us took the other\\'s life now we\\'d be pariahs when \\nwe returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was \\nwatching I\\'d loathe any tribute who didn\\'t \\nimmediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it \\njust makes sense to protect each other. And in my \\ncase \\xe2\\x80\\x94 being one of the star-crossed lovers from \\nDistrict 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s an absolute requirement if I want \\nany more help from sympathetic sponsors. \\n\\nThe star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been \\nplaying that angle all along. Why else would the \\nGamemakers have made this unprecedented change \\nin the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at \\nwinning, our \"romance\" must be so popular with the \\naudience that condemning it would jeopardize the \\nsuccess of the Games. No thanks to me. All I\\'ve done \\nis managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he\\'s done \\nin the arena, he must have the audience convinced it \\nwas to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me \\nfrom running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let \\nme escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must \\nhave been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, \\nhas never been a danger to me. \\n\\n\\n\\n234 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and \\nhold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can \\nbe sure to catch it. \\n\\nSo, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy \\ntribute from her district is dead. She\\'s operating \\nalone, at night. And her strategy has been to evade, \\nnot attack. I don\\'t really think that, even if she heard \\nmy voice, she\\'d do anything but hope someone else \\nwould kill me. \\n\\nThen there\\'s Thresh. All right, he\\'s a distinct threat. \\nBut I haven\\'t seen him, not once, since the Games \\nbegan. I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when \\nshe heard a sound at the site of the explosion. But \\nshe didn\\'t turn to the Woods, she turned to whatever \\nlies across from it. To that area of the arena that \\ndrops off into I don\\'t know what. I feel almost certain \\nthat the person she ran from was Thresh and that is \\nhis domain. He\\'d never have heard me from there \\nand, even if he did, I\\'m up too high for someone his \\nsize to reach. \\n\\nSo that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who \\nare now surely celebrating the new rule. They\\'re the \\nonly ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and \\nmyself. Do I run from them now, on the chance they \\nheard me call Peeta\\'s name?No,I think. Let them \\ncome. Let them come with their night-vision glasses \\nand their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. \\n\\nRight into the range of my arrows. But I know they \\nwon\\'t. If they didn\\'t come in daylight to my fire, they \\nwon\\'t risk what could be another trap at night. When \\nthey come, it will be on their own terms, not because \\nI\\'ve let them know my whereabouts. \\n\\n\\n\\n235 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nStay put and get some sleep, Katniss,I instruct \\nmyself, although I wish I could start tracking Peeta \\nnow. Tomorrow, you\\'ll find him. \\n\\nI do sleep, but in the morning I\\'m extra- cautious, \\nthinking that while the Careers might hesitate to \\nattack me in a tree, they\\'re completely capable of \\nsetting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully \\nprepare myself for the day \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eating a big breakfast, \\nsecuring my pack, readying my weapons \\xe2\\x80\\x94 before I \\ndescend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on \\nthe ground. \\n\\nToday 111 have to be scrupulously careful. The \\nCareers will know I\\'m trying to locate Peeta. They may \\nwell want to wait until I do before they move in. If he\\'s \\nas badly wounded as Cato thinks, I\\'d be in the \\nposition of having to defend us both without any \\nassistance. But if he\\'s that incapacitated, how has he \\nmanaged to stay alive? And how on earth will I find \\nhim? \\n\\nI try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might \\ngive me an indication as to where he\\'s hiding out, but \\nnothing rings a bell. So I go back to the last moment I \\nsaw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to \\nrun. Then Cato appeared, his sword drawn. And after \\nI was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did Peeta get \\naway? Maybe he\\'d held out better against the tracker \\nj acker poison than Cato. \\n\\nMaybe that was the variable that allowed him to \\nescape. But he\\'d been stung, too. So how far could he \\nhave gotten, stabbed and filled with venom? And how \\nhas he stayed alive all these days since? If the wound \\nand the stingers haven\\'t killed him, surely thirst \\nwould have taken him by now. \\n\\n\\n\\n236 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when I get my first clue to his \\nwhereabouts. He couldn\\'t have survived without \\nwater. I know that from my first few days here. He \\nmust be hidden somewhere near a source. There\\'s the \\nlake, but I find that an unlikely option since it\\'s so \\nclose to the Careers\\' base camp. A few spring-fed \\npools. But you\\'d really be a sitting duck at one of \\nthose. And the stream. The one that leads from the \\ncamp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake \\nand beyond. If he stuck to the stream, he could \\nchange his location and always be near water. He \\ncould walk in the current and erase any tracks. He \\nmight even be able to get a fish or two. \\n\\nWell, it\\'s a place to start, anyway. \\n\\nTo confuse my enemies\\' minds, I start a fire with \\nplenty of green wood. Even if they think it\\'s a ruse, I \\nhope they\\'ll decide I\\'m hidden somewhere near it. \\nWhile in reality, I\\'ll be tracking Peeta. \\n\\nThe sun burns off the morning haze almost \\nimmediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than \\nusual. The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet \\nas I head downstream. I\\'m tempted to call out Peeta\\'s \\nname as I go but decide against it. I will have to find \\nhim with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to \\nfind me. But he\\'ll know 111 be looking, right? He won\\'t \\nhave so low of an opinion of me as to think I\\'d ignore \\nthe new rule and keep to myself. Would he? He\\'s very \\nhard to predict, which might be interesting under \\ndifferent circumstances, but at the moment only \\nprovides an extra obstacle. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to reach the spot where I peeled \\noff to go the Careers\\' camp. There\\'s been no sign of \\nPeeta, but this doesn\\'t surprise me. I\\'ve been up and \\ndown this stretch three times since the tracker jacker \\nincident. If he were nearby, surely I\\'d have had some \\n237 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nsuspicion of it. The stream begins to curve to the left \\ninto a part of the woods that\\'s new to me. Muddy \\nbanks covered in tangled water plants lead to large \\nrocks that increase in size until I begin to feel \\nsomewhat trapped. It would be no small matter to \\nescape the stream now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as \\nI climbed over this rocky terrain. In fact, I\\'ve just \\nabout decided I\\'m on the wrong track entirely, that a \\nwounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to \\nand from this water source, when I see the bloody \\nstreak going down the curve of a boulder. It\\'s long \\ndried now, but the smeary lines running side to side \\nsuggest someone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who perhaps was not fully in \\ncontrol of his mental faculties \\xe2\\x80\\x94 tried to wipe it away. \\n\\nHugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of \\nthe blood, searching for him. I find a few more \\nbloodstains, one with a few threads of fabric glued to \\nit, but no sign of life. I break down and say his name \\nin a hushed voice. \"Peeta! Peeta!\" Then a mockingjay \\nlands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones \\nso I stop. I give up and climb back down to the stream \\nthinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther \\ndown. \\n\\nMy foot has just broken the surface of the water when \\nI hear a voice. \\n\\n\"You here to finish me off, sweetheart?\" \\n\\nI whip around. It\\'s come from the left, so I can\\'t pick \\nit up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. \\nStill, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena \\nwould call me sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, \\nbut there\\'s nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of \\nthe rocks. \\n\\n\"Peeta?\" I whisper. \"Where are you?\" There\\'s no \\nanswer. Could I just have imagined it? No, I\\'m certain \\n238 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nit was real and very close at hand, too. \"Peeta?\" I \\ncreep along the bank. \\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t step on me.\" \\n\\nI jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still \\nthere\\'s nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably \\nblue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and \\nam rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs. \\n\\nIt\\'s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking \\nweights around. Peeta should have gone into his \\nprivate session with the Gamemakers and painted \\nhimself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank \\nfull of weeds. \\n\\n\"Close your eyes again,\" I order. He does, and his \\nmouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what \\nI judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud \\nand plants. His face and arms are so artfully \\ndisguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him. \"I \\nguess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.\" \\n\\nPeeta smiles. \"Yes, frosting. The final defense of the \\ndying.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re not going to die,\" I tell him firmly. \"Says who?\" \\nHis voice is so ragged. \"Says me. We\\'re on the same \\nteam now, you know,\" I tell him. \\n\\nHis eyes open. \"So, I heard. Nice of you to find what\\'s \\nleft of me.\" \\n\\nI pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. \"Did \\nCato cut you?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Left leg. Up high,\" he answers. \\n\\n\\n\\n239 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see \\nwhat kind of wounds you\\'ve got,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Lean down a minute first,\" he says. \"Need to tell you \\nsomething.\" I lean over and put my good ear to his \\nlips, which tickle as he whispers. \"Remember, we\\'re \\nmadly in love, so it\\'s all right to kiss me anytime you \\nfeel like it.\" \\n\\nI jerk my head back but end up laughing. \"Thanks, 111 \\nkeep it in mind.\" At least, he\\'s still able to joke \\naround. But when I start to help him to the stream, \\nall the levity disappears. It\\'s only two feet away, how \\nhard can it be? Very hard when I realize he\\'s unable \\nto move an inch on his own. He\\'s so weak that the \\nbest he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but \\ndespite the fact that I know he\\'s doing all he can to \\nkeep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him. The mud \\nand plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally \\nhave to give a gigantic tug to break him from their \\nclutches. He\\'s still two feet from the water, lying \\nthere, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on \\nhis face. \\n\\n\"Look, Peeta, I\\'m going to roll you into the stream. It\\'s \\nvery shallow here, okay?\" I say. \\n\\n\"Excellent,\" he says. \\n\\nI crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, I \\ntell myself, don\\'t stop until he\\'s in the water. \"On \\nthree,\" I say. \"One, two, three!\" I can only manage one \\nfull roll before I have to stop because of the horrible \\nsound he\\'s making. Now he\\'s on the edge of the \\nstream. Maybe this is better anyway. \\n\\n\"Okay, change of plans. I\\'m not going to put you all \\nthe way in,\" I tell him. Besides, if I get him in, who \\nknows if I\\'d ever be able to get him out? \\n240 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"No more rolling?\" he asks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s all done. Let\\'s get you cleaned up. Keep an eye \\non the woods for me, okay?\" I say. It\\'s hard to know \\nwhere to start. He so caked with mud and matted \\nleaves, I can\\'t even see his clothes. If he\\'s wearing \\nclothes. The thought makes me hesitate a moment, \\nbut then I plunge in. Naked bodies are no big deal in \\nthe arena, right? \\n\\nI\\'ve got two water bottles and Rue\\'s water skin. I prop \\nthem against rocks in the stream so that two are \\nalways filling while I pour the third over Peeta\\'s body. \\nIt takes a while, but I finally get rid of enough mud to \\nfind his clothes. I gently unzip his jacket, unbutton \\nhis shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt is so \\nplastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with \\nmy knife and drench him again to work it loose. He\\'s \\nbadly bruised with a long burn across his chest and \\nfour tracker j acker stings, if you count the one under \\nhis ear. But I feel a bit better. This much I can fix. I \\ndecide to take care of his upper body first, to alleviate \\nsome pain, before I tackle whatever damage Cato did \\nto his leg. \\n\\nSince treating his wounds seems pointless when he\\'s \\nlying in what\\'s become a mud puddle, I manage to \\nprop him up against a boulder. He sits there, \\nuncomplaining, while I wash away all the traces of \\ndirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is very pale in \\nthe sunlight and he no longer looks strong and \\nstocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker \\njacker lumps, which causes him to wince, but the \\nminute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he \\ndries in the sun, I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and \\nspread them over boulders. Then I apply the burn \\ncream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his \\nskin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of \\nwater have disguised the fact that he\\'s burning with \\n\\n\\n\\n241 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy \\nfrom District 1 and find pills that reduce your \\ntemperature. My mother actually breaks down and \\nbuys these on occasion when her home remedies fail. \\n\\n\"Swallow these,\" I tell him, and he obediently takes \\nthe medicine. \"You must be hungry.\" \\n\\n\"Not really. It\\'s funny, I haven\\'t been hungry for \\ndays,\" says Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, \\nhe wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. That\\'s \\nwhen I know how sick he is. \\n\\n\"Peeta, we need to get some food in you,\" I insist. \\n\\n\"It\\'ll just come right back up,\" he says. The best I can \\ndo is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. \\n\"Thanks. I\\'m much better, really. Can I sleep now, \\nKatniss?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Soon,\" I promise. \"I need to look at your leg \\nfirst. \"Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his \\nboots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants \\noff of him. I can see the tear Cato\\'s sword made in the \\nfabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for \\nwhat lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing \\nboth blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst \\nof all, the smell of festering flesh. \\n\\nI want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I \\ndid that day they brought the burn victim to our \\nhouse. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim \\nattend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage \\nto face. But there\\'s no one here but me. I try to \\ncapture the calm demeanor my mother assumes \\nwhen handling particularly bad cases. \\n\\n\"Pretty awful, huh?\" says Peeta. He\\'s watching me \\nclosely. \\n\\n242 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"So-so.\" I shrug like it\\'s no big deal. \"You should see \\nsome of the people they bring my mother from the \\nmines.\" I refrain from saying how I usually clear out \\nof the house whenever she\\'s treating anything worse \\nthan a cold. Come to think of it, I don\\'t even much \\nlike to be around coughing. \"First thing is to clean it \\nwell.\" \\n\\nI\\'ve left on Peeta\\'s undershorts because they\\'re not in \\nbad shape and I don\\'t want to pull them over the \\nswollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him \\nbeing naked makes me uncomfortable. That\\'s another \\nthing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no \\neffect on them, gives them no cause for \\nembarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the \\nGames, my little sister would be of far more use to \\nPeeta than I am. I scoot my square of plastic under \\nhim so I can wash down the rest of him. With each \\nbottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. \\nThe rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just \\none tracker j acker sting and a few small burns that I \\ntreat quickly. But the gash on his leg ... what on earth \\ncan I do for that? \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t we give it some air and then ...\" I trail off. \\n\\n\"And then youll patch it up?\" says Peeta. He looks \\nalmost sorry for me, as if he knows how lost I am. \\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" I say. \"In the meantime, you eat \\nthese. \"I put a few dried pear halves in his hand and \\ngo back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes. \\nWhen they\\'re flattened out and drying, I examine the \\ncontents of the first-aid kit. It\\'s pretty basic stuff. \\nBandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs. \\nNothing of the caliber I\\'ll need to treat Peeta. \\n\\n\"We\\'re going to have to experiment some,\" I admit. I \\nknow the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I \\n243 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nstart with those. Within minutes of pressing the \\nhandful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus \\nbegins running down the side of his leg. I tell myself \\nthis is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek \\nhard because my breakfast is threatening to make a \\nreappearance. \\n\\n\"Katniss?\" Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my \\nface must be some shade of green. He mouths the \\nwords. \"How about that kiss?\" \\n\\nI burst out laughing because the whole thing is so \\nrevolting I can\\'t stand it. \\n\\n\"Something wrong?\" he asks a little too innocently. \\n\\n\"I ... I\\'m no good at this. I\\'m not my mother. I\\'ve no \\nidea what I\\'m doing and I hate pus,\" I say. \"Euh!\" I \\nallow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first \\nround of leaves and apply the second. \"Euuuh!\" \\n\\n\"How do you hunt?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this,\" I \\nsay. \"Although for all I know, I am killing you.\" \\n\\n\"Can you speed it up a little?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"No. Shut up and eat your pears,\" I say. \\n\\nAfter three applications and what seems like a bucket \\nof pus, the wound does look better. Now that the \\nswelling has gone down, I can see how deep Cato\\'s \\nsword cut. Right down to the bone. \\n\\n\"What next, Dr. Everdeen?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Maybe 111 put some of the burn ointment on it. I \\nthink it helps with infection anyway. And wrap it up?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n244 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI say. I do and the whole thing seems a lot more \\nmanageable, covered in clean white cotton. Although, \\nagainst the sterile bandage, the hem of his \\nundershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion. I \\npull out Rue\\'s backpack. \"Here, cover yourself with \\nthis and 111 wash your shorts.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t care if you see me,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"You\\'re just like the rest of my family,\" I say. \"I care, \\nall right?\" I turn my back and look at the stream until \\nthe undershorts splash into the current. He must be \\nfeeling a bit better if he can throw. \\n\\n\"You know, you\\'re kind of squeamish for such a lethal \\nperson,\" says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between \\ntwo rocks. \"I wish I\\'d let you give Haymitch a shower \\nafter all.\" \\n\\nI wrinkle my nose at the memory. \"What\\'s he sent you \\nso far?\" \\n\\n\"Not a thing,\" says Peeta. Then there\\'s a pause as it \\nhits him. \"Why, did you get something?\" \\n\\n\"Burn medicine,\" I say almost sheepishly. \"Oh, and \\nsome bread.\" \\n\\n\"I always knew you were his favorite,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Please, he can\\'t stand being in the same room with \\nme, \"I say. \\n\\n\"Because you\\'re just alike,\" mutters Peeta. I ignore it \\nthough because this really isn\\'t the time for me to be \\ninsulting Haymitch, which is my first impulse. \\n\\n\\n\\n245 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by \\nlate afternoon, I don\\'t dare wait any longer. I gently \\nshake his shoulder. \"Peeta, we\\'ve got to go now.\" \\n\\n\"Go?\" He seems confused. \"Go where?\" \\n\\n\"Away from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we \\ncan hide you until you\\'re stronger,\" I say. I help him \\ndress, leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the \\nwater, and pull him upright. His face drains of color \\nthe moment he puts weight on his leg. \"Come on. You \\ncan do this.\" \\n\\nBut he can\\'t. Not for long anyway. We make it about \\nfifty yards downstream, with him propped up by my \\nshoulder, and I can tell he\\'s going to black out. I sit \\nhim on the bank, push his head between his knees, \\nand pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area. Of \\ncourse, I\\'d love to get him up in a tree, but that\\'s not \\ngoing to happen. It could be worse though. Some of \\nthe rocks form small cavelike structures. I set my \\nsights on one about twenty yards above the stream. \\nWhen Peeta\\'s able to stand, I half-guide, half-carry \\nhim up to the cave. Really, I\\'d like to look around for \\na better place, but this one will have to do because \\nmy ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even \\nthough it\\'s only just cooling off, he\\'s shivering. \\n\\nI cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine \\nneedles, unroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. \\nI get a couple of pills and some water into him when \\nhe\\'s not noticing, but he refuses to eat even the fruit. \\nThen he just lies there, his eyes trained on my face as \\nI build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the \\nmouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An \\nanimal might not question it, but a human would see \\nhands had manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it \\ndown in frustration. \\n\\n\\n\\n246 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he says. I go over to him and brush the \\nhair back from his eyes. \"Thanks for finding me.\" \\n\\n\"You would have found me if you could,\" I say. His \\nforehead\\'s burning up. Like the medicine\\'s having no \\neffect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I\\'m scared he\\'s \\ngoing to die. \\n\\n\"Yes. Look, if I don\\'t make it back \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he begins. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk like that. I didn\\'t drain all that pus for \\nnothing,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I know. But just in case I don\\'t \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he tries to \\ncontinue. \\n\\n\"No, Peeta, I don\\'t even want to discuss it,\" I say, \\nplacing my fingers on his lips to quiet him. \\n\\n\"But I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he insists. \\n\\nImpulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his \\nwords. This is probably overdue anyway since he\\'s \\nright, we are supposed to be madly in love. It\\'s the \\nfirst time I\\'ve ever kissed a boy, which should make \\nsome sort of impression I guess, but all I can register \\nis how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever. I \\nbreak away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up \\naround him. \"You\\'re not going to die. I forbid it. All \\nright?\" \\n\\n\"All right,\" he whispers. \\n\\nI step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute \\nfloats down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the \\ntie, hoping for some real medicine to treat Peeta\\'s leg. \\nInstead I find a pot of hot broth. \\n\\n\\n\\n247 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch couldn\\'t be sending me a clearer message. \\nOne kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear \\nhis snarl. \"You\\'re supposed to be in love, sweetheart. \\nThe boy\\'s dying. Give me something I can work with!\" \\n\\nAnd he\\'s right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, I\\'ve got to \\ngive the audience something more to care about. Star- \\ncrossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two \\nhearts beating as one. Romance. \\n\\nNever having been in love, this is going to be a real \\ntrick. I think of my parents. The way my father never \\nfailed to bring her gifts from the woods. The way my \\nmother\\'s face would light up at the sound of his boots \\nat the door. The way she almost stopped living when \\nhe died. \\n\\n\"Peeta!\" I say, trying for the special tone that my \\nmother used only with my father. He\\'s dozed off \\nagain, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle \\nhim. Then he smiles as if he\\'d be happy to lie there \\ngazing at me forever. He\\'s great at this stuff. \\n\\nI hold up the pot. \"Peeta, look what Haymitch has \\nsent you.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n248 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\n\\nGetting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, \\nbegging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip \\nby sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep \\nthen and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a \\nsupper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily \\nreport in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I \\nhave given the audience a fairly interesting day. \\nHopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful \\nnight. \\n\\nI automatically look around for a good tree to nest in \\nbefore I realize that\\'s over. At least for a while. I can\\'t \\nvery well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground. I left \\nthe scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the \\nstream untouched \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how could I conceal it? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and \\nwe\\'re a scant fifty yards downstream. I put on my \\nglasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle \\ndown to keep watch. \\n\\nThe temperature drops rapidly and soon I\\'m chilled to \\nthe bone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the \\nsleeping bag with Peeta. It\\'s toasty warm and I \\nsnuggle down gratefully until I realize it\\'s more than \\nwarm, it\\'s overly hot because the bag is reflecting \\nback his fever. I check his forehead and find it \\nburning and dry. I don\\'t know what to do. Leave him \\nin the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the \\nfever? Take him out and hope the night air cools him \\noff? I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and \\nplacing it on his forehead. It seems weak, but I\\'m \\nafraid to do anything too drastic. \\n\\nI spend the night half- sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, \\nrefreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the \\nfact that by teaming up with him, I\\'ve made myself far \\n249 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmore vulnerable than when I was alone. Tethered to \\nthe ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take \\ncare of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came \\nafter him. I\\'m just going to have to trust that \\nwhatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. \\n\\nWhen the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat \\non Peeta\\'s lip and discover the fever has broken. He\\'s \\nnot back to normal, but it\\'s come down a few degrees. \\nLast night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a \\nbush of Rue\\'s berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it \\nup in the broth pot with cold water. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s struggling to get up when I reach the cave. \"I \\nwoke up and you were gone,\" he says. \"I was worried \\nabout you.\" \\n\\nI have to laugh as I ease him back down. \"You were \\nworried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself \\nlately?\" \\n\\n\"I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. \\nThey like to hunt at night,\" he says, still serious. \\n\\n\"Clove? Which one is that?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"The girl from District Two. She\\'s still alive, right?\"he \\nsays. \\n\\n\"Yes, there\\'s just them and us and Thresh and \\nFoxface,\"I say. \"That\\'s what I nicknamed the girl from \\nFive. How do you feel?\" \\n\\n\"Better than yesterday. This is an enormous \\nimprovement over the mud,\" he says. \"Clean clothes \\nand medicine and a sleeping bag ... and you.\" \\n\\nOh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to \\ntouch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses \\n\\n\\n\\n250 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nit against his lips. I remember my father doing this \\nvery thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta \\npicked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch. \\n\\n\"No more kisses for you until you\\'ve eaten,\" I say. \\n\\nWe get him propped up against the wall and he \\nobediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I \\nfeed him. He refuses the groosling again, though. \\n\\n\"You didn\\'t sleep,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"I\\'m all right,\" I say. But the truth is, I\\'m exhausted. \\n\\n\"Sleep now. Ill keep watch. Ill wake you if anything \\nhappens,\" he says. I hesitate. \"Katniss, you can\\'t stay \\nup forever.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s got a point there. I\\'ll have to sleep eventually. \\nAnd probably better to do it now when he seems \\nrelatively alert and we have daylight on our side. \"All \\nright,\" I say. \"But just for a few hours. Then you wake \\nme.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out \\non the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my \\nloaded bow in case I have to shoot at a moment\\'s \\nnotice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, \\nhis bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained \\non the world outside. \"Go to sleep,\" he says softly. His \\nhand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my \\nforehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so \\nfar, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I don\\'t \\nwant him to stop and he doesn\\'t. He\\'s still stroking \\nmy hair when I fall asleep. \\n\\nToo long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I \\nopen my eyes that we\\'re into the afternoon. Peeta\\'s \\nright beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up, \\n251 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfeeling somehow defensive but better rested than I\\'ve \\nbeen in days. \\n\\n\"Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple \\nof hours,\" I say. \\n\\n\"For what? Nothing\\'s going on here,\" he says. \\n\"Besides I like watching you sleep. You don\\'t scowl. \\nImproves your looks a lot.\" \\n\\nThis, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him \\ngrin. That\\'s when I notice how dry his lips are. I test \\nhis cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims he\\'s been \\ndrinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give \\nhim more fever pills and stand over him while he \\ndrinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I \\ntend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, \\nwhich are showing improvement. I steel myself and \\nunwrap the leg. \\n\\nMy heart drops into my stomach. It\\'s worse, much \\nworse. There\\'s no more pus in evidence, but the \\nswelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is \\ninflamed. Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl \\nup his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill \\nhim for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment \\nwon\\'t make a dent in it. Well need strong anti- \\ninfection drugs from the Capitol. I can\\'t imagine the \\ncost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled \\nevery donation from every sponsor, would he have \\nenough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the \\nGames continue. What buys a full meal on day one \\nbuys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of \\nmedicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium \\nfrom the beginning. \\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s more swelling, but the pus is gone,\" I \\nsay in an unsteady voice. \\n\\n\\n\\n252 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,\" says \\nPeeta.\"Even if my mother isn\\'t a healer.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. \\nThey\\'ll cure it back at the Capitol when we win,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s a good plan,\" he says. But I feel this is \\nmostly for my benefit. \\n\\n\"You have to eat. Keep your strength up. I\\'m going to \\nmake you soup,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t light a fire,\" he says. \"It\\'s not worth it.\" \\n\\n\"Well see,\" I say. As I take the pot down to the \\nstream, I\\'m struck by how brutally hot it is. I swear \\nthe Gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the \\ntemperature in the daytime and sending it \\nplummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked \\nstones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe \\nI won\\'t need to light a fire. \\n\\nI settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the \\nstream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of \\nwater, I place it in direct sunlight and add several \\negg- size hot stones to the water. I\\'m the first to admit \\nI\\'m not much of a cook. But since soup mainly \\ninvolves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, it\\'s \\none of my better dishes. I mince groosling until it\\'s \\npractically mush and mash some of Rue\\'s roots. \\nFortunately, they\\'ve both been roasted already so they \\nmostly need to be heated up. Already, between the \\nsunlight and the rocks, the water\\'s warm. I put in the \\nmeat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find \\nsomething green to spice it up a little. Before long, I \\ndiscover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some \\nrocks. Perfect. I chop them very fine and add them to \\nthe pot, switch out the rocks again, put on the lid, \\nand let the whole thing stew. \\n\\n253 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve seen very few signs of game around, but I don\\'t \\nfeel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt, so I \\nrig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky. I wonder \\nabout the other tributes, how they\\'re managing now \\nthat their main source of food has been blown up. At \\nleast three of them, Cato, Clove, and Foxface, had \\nbeen relying on it. Probably not Thresh though. I\\'ve \\ngot a feeling he must share some of Rue\\'s knowledge \\non how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they \\nfighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of \\nthem has located us and is just waiting for the right \\nmoment to attack. The idea sends me back to the \\ncave. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the \\nshade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when \\nI come in, it\\'s clear he feels miserable. I put cool \\ncloths on his head, but they warm up almost as soon \\nas they touch his skin. \\n\\n\"Do you want anything?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"No,\" he says. \"Thank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story.\" \\n\\n\"A story? What about?\" I say. I\\'m not much for \\nstorytelling. It\\'s kind of like singing. But once in a \\nwhile, Prim wheedles one out of me. \\n\\n\"Something happy. Tell me about the happiest day \\nyou can remember,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nSomething between a sigh and a huff of exasperation \\nleaves my mouth. A happy story? This will require a \\nlot more effort than the soup. I rack my brains for \\ngood memories. Most of them involve Gale and me out \\nhunting and somehow I don\\'t think these will play \\nwell with either Peeta or the audience. That leaves \\nPrim. \\n\\n\\n\\n254 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did I ever tell you about how I got Prim\\'s goat?\" I \\nask. Peeta shakes his head, and looks at me \\nexpectantly. So I begin. But carefully. Because my \\nwords are going out all over Panem. And while people \\nhave no doubt put two and two together that I hunt \\nillegally, I don\\'t want to hurt Gale or Greasy Sae or \\nthe butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who \\nare my customers by publicly announcing they\\'d \\nbreaking the law, too. \\n\\nHere\\'s the real story of how I got the money for Prim\\'s \\ngoat, Lady. It was a Friday evening, the day before \\nPrim\\'s tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school \\nended, Gale and I hit the woods, because I wanted to \\nget enough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe \\nsome new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our \\nsnares had done well enough and the woods were \\nflush with greens, but this was really no more than \\nour average Friday- night haul. I was disappointed as \\nwe headed back, even though Gale said we\\'d be sure \\nto do better tomorrow. We were resting a moment by \\na stream when we saw him. A young buck, probably a \\nyearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, \\nstill small and coated in velvet. Poised to run but \\nunsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful. \\n\\nLess beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught \\nhim, one in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and \\nI had shot at the same time. The buck tried to run \\nbut stumbled, and Gale\\'s knife slit his throat before \\nhe knew what had happened. Momentarily, I\\'d felt a \\npang at killing something so fresh and innocent. And \\nthen my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that \\nfresh and innocent meat. \\n\\nA deer! Gale and I have only brought down three in \\nall. The first one, a doe that had injured her leg \\nsomehow, almost didn\\'t count. But we knew from that \\nexperience not to go dragging the carcass into the \\n255 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHob. It had caused chaos with people bidding on \\nparts and actually trying to hack off pieces \\nthemselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us \\nwith our deer to the butcher, but not before it\\'d been \\nbadly damaged, hunks of meat taken, the hide riddled \\nwith holes. Although everybody paid up fairly, it had \\nlowered the value of the kill. \\n\\nThis time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under \\na hole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though \\nwe were known hunters, it wouldn\\'t have been good \\nto go carrying a 150-pound deer through the streets \\nof District 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the \\nofficials\\' faces. \\n\\nThe butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, \\ncame to the back door when we knocked. You don\\'t \\nhaggle with Rooba. She gives you one price, which \\nyou can take or leave, but it\\'s a fair price. We took her \\noffer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison \\nsteaks we could pick up after the butchering. Even \\nwith the money divided in two, neither Gale nor I had \\nheld so much at one time in our lives. We decided to \\nkeep it a secret and surprise our families with the \\nmeat and money at the end of the next day. \\n\\nThis is where I really got the money for the goat, but I \\ntell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mother\\'s. \\nThat can\\'t hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in \\nthe late afternoon of Prim\\'s birthday. \\n\\nGale and I went to the market on the square so that I \\ncould buy dress materials. As I was running my \\nfingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, \\nsomething caughtmyeye. There\\'s an old man who \\nkeeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the \\nSeam. I don\\'t know his real name, everyone just calls \\nhim the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted \\nin painful angles, and he\\'s got a hacking cough that \\n256 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nproves he spent years in the mines. But he\\'s lucky. \\nSomewhere along the way he saved up enough for \\nthese goats and now has something to do in his old \\nage besides slowly starve to death. He\\'s filthy and \\nimpatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is \\nrich if you can afford it. \\n\\nOne of the goats, a white one with black patches, was \\nlying down in a cart. It was easy to see why. \\nSomething, probably a dog, had mauled her shoulder \\nand infection had set in. It was bad, the Goat Man \\nhad to hold her up to milk her. But I thought I knew \\nsomeone who could fix it. \\n\\n\"Gale,\" I whispered. \"I want that goat for Prim.\" \\n\\nOwning a nanny goat can change your life in District \\n12. The animals can live off almost anything, the \\nMeadow\\'s a perfect feeding place, and they can give \\nfour quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into \\ncheese, to sell. It\\'s not even against the law. \\n\\n\"She\\'s hurt pretty bad,\" said Gale. \"We better take a \\ncloser look.\" \\n\\nWe went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then \\nstood over the goat as if idly curious. \\n\\n\"Let her be,\" said the man. \\n\\n\"Just looking,\" said Gale. \\n\\n\"Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly \\nanyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half \\nprice,\" said the man. \\n\\n\"What\\'s the butcher giving for her?\" I asked. \\n\\n\\n\\n257 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe man shrugged. \"Hang around and see.\" I turned \\nand saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. \\n\"Lucky thing you showed up,\" said the Goat Man \\nwhen she arrived. \"Girl\\'s got her eye on your goat.\" \\n\\n\"Not if she\\'s spoken for,\" I said carelessly. \\n\\nRooba looked me up and down then frowned at the \\ngoat. \"She\\'s not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half \\nthe carcass will be too rotten for even sausage.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" said the Goat Man. \"We had a deal.\" \\n\\n\"We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. \\nNot that thing. Sell her to the girl if she\\'s stupid \\nenough to take her,\" said Rooba. As she marched off, \\nI caught her wink. \\n\\nThe Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal \\noff his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the \\nprice. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand \\nout opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; \\nI\\'d been robbed if she died. People took sides in the \\nargument, but I took the goat. \\n\\nGale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the \\nlook on Prim\\'s face as much as I did. In a moment of \\ncomplete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it \\naround her neck. Then we hurried back to my house. \\n\\nYou should have seen Prim\\'s reaction when we \\nwalked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who \\nwept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was \\nso excited she started crying and laughing all at once. \\nMy mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the \\npair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs \\nand coaxing brews down the animal\\'s throat. \\n\\n\\n\\n258 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"They sound like you,\" says Peeta. I had almost \\nforgotten he was there. \\n\\n\"Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn\\'t \\nhave died if it tried,\" I say. But then I bite my tongue, \\nrealizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is \\ndying, in my incompetent hands. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not trying,\" he jokes. \"Finish the \\nstory.\" \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s it. Only I remember that night, Prim \\ninsisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to \\nthe fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat \\nlicked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night \\nkiss or something,\" I say. \"It was already mad about \\nher.\" \\n\\n\"Was it still wearing the pink ribbon?\" he asks. \\n\"I think so,\" I say. \"Why?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m just trying to get a picture,\" he says thoughtfully. \\n\"I can see why that day made you happy.\" \\n\\n\"Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,\" 1 \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting \\njoy you gave the sister you love so much you took her \\nplace in the reaping,\" says Peeta drily. \\n\\n\"The goat has paid for itself. Several times over,\" I say \\nin a superior tone. \\n\\n\"Well, it wouldn\\'t dare do anything else after you \\nsaved its life,\" says Peeta. \"I intend to do the same \\nthing.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n259 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Really? What did you cost me again?\" I ask. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"A lot of trouble. Don\\'t worry. You\\'ll get it all back,\"he \\nsays. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not making sense,\" I say. I test his forehead. \\nThe lever\\'s going nowhere but up. \"You\\'re a little \\ncooler though.\" \\n\\nThe sound of the trumpets startles me. I\\'m on my feet \\nand at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting \\nto miss a syllable. It\\'s my new best friend, Claudius \\nTemplesmith, and as I expected, he\\'s inviting us to a \\nfeast. Well, we\\'re not that hungry and I actually wave \\nhis offer away in indifference when he says, \"Now hold \\non. Some of you may already be declining my \\ninvitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you \\nneeds something desperately.\" \\n\\nI do need something desperately. Something to heal \\nPeeta\\'s leg. \\n\\n\"Each of you will find that something in a backpack, \\nmarked with your district number, at the Cornucopia \\nat dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For \\nsome of you, this will be your last chance,\" says \\nClaudius. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing else, just his words hanging in the \\nair. I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. \\n\"No,\" he says. \"You\\'re not risking your life for me.\" \\n\\n\"Who said I was?\" I say. \\n\\n\"So, you\\'re not going?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Of course, I\\'m not going. Give me some credit. Do \\nyou think I\\'m running straight into some free-for-all \\nagainst Cato and Clove and Thresh? Don\\'t be stupid,\" \\n\\n\\n\\n260 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI say, helping him back to bed. \"I\\'ll let them fight it \\nout, well see who\\'s in the sky tomorrow night and \\nwork out a plan from there.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re such a bad liar, Katniss. I don\\'t know how \\nyou\\'ve survived this long.\" He begins to mimic me. \"I \\nknew that goat would be a little gold mine. You\\'re a \\nlittle cooler though. Of course, I\\'m not going. He \\nshakes his head. \"Never gamble at cards. You\\'ll lose \\nyour last coin,\" he says. \\n\\nAnger flushes my face. \"All right, I am going, and you \\ncan\\'t stop me!\" \\n\\n\"I can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it \\nto the Cornucopia, but if I\\'m yelling your name, I bet \\nsomeone can find me. And then I\\'ll be dead for sure,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\n\"You won\\'t get a hundred yards from here on that \\nleg,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Then 111 drag myself,\" says Peeta. \"You go and I\\'m \\ngoing, too.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s just stubborn enough and maybe just strong \\nenough to do it. Come howling after me in the woods. \\nEven if a tribute doesn\\'t find him, something else \\nmight. He can\\'t defend himself. I\\'d probably have to \\nwall him up in the cave just to go myself. And who \\nknows what the exertion will do to him? \\n\\n\"What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you \\ndie?\"I say. He must know that\\'s not an option. That \\nthe audience would hate me. And frankly, I would \\nhate myself, too, if I didn\\'t even try. \\n\\n\"I won\\'t die. I promise. If you promise not to go,\" he \\nsays. \\n\\n\\n\\n261 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re at something of a stalemate. I know I can\\'t \\nargue him out of this one, so I don\\'t try. I pretend, \\nreluctantly, to go along. \"Then you have to do what I \\nsay. Drink your water, wake me when I tell you, and \\neat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it \\nis!\" I snap at him. \\n\\n\"Agreed. Is it ready?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Wait here,\" I say. The air\\'s gone cold even though the \\nsun\\'s still up. I\\'m right about the Gamemakers \\nmessing with the temperature. I wonder if the thing \\nsomeone needs desperately is a good blanket. The \\nsoup is still nice and warm in its iron pot. And \\nactually doesn\\'t taste too bad. \\n\\nPeeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the \\npot to show his enthusiasm. He rambles on about \\nhow delicious it is, which should be encouraging if \\nyou don\\'t know what fever does to people. He\\'s like \\nlistening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked \\nhim into incoherence. I give him another dose of fever \\nmedicine before he goes off his head completely. \\n\\nAs I go down to the stream to wash up, all I can think \\nis that he\\'s going to die if I don\\'t get to that feast. I\\'ll \\nkeep him going for a day or two, and then the \\ninfection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs \\nand he\\'ll be gone. And 111 be here all alone. Again. \\nWaiting for the others. \\n\\nI\\'m so lost in thought that I almost miss the \\nparachute, even though it floats right by me. Then I \\nspring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off \\nthe silver fabric to retrieve the vial. Haymitch has \\ndone it! He\\'s gotten the medicine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\'t know how, \\npersuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their \\njewels \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I can save Peeta! It\\'s such a tiny vial \\nthough. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill \\n262 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nas Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork \\nthe vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the \\nsickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on \\nthe tip of my tongue. There\\'s no question, it\\'s sleep \\nsyrup. It\\'s a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, \\nas medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost \\neveryone\\'s had a dose at one time or another. We \\nhave some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to \\nhysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a \\nbad wound or quiet their minds or just to help \\nsomeone in pain get through the night. It only takes a \\nlittle. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full \\nday, but what good is that? I\\'m so furious I\\'m about \\nto throw Haymitch\\'s last offering into the stream \\nwhen it hits me. A full day? That\\'s more than I need. \\n\\nI mash up a handful of berries so the taste won\\'t be \\nas noticeable and add some mint leaves for good \\nmeasure. Then I head back up to the cave. \"I\\'ve \\nbrought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a \\nlittle farther downstream.\" \\n\\nPeeta opens his mouth for the first bite without \\nhesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. \"They\\'re \\nvery sweet.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, they\\'re sugar berries. My mother makes jam \\nfrom them. Haven\\'t you ever had them before?\" I say, \\npoking the next spoonful in his mouth. \\n\\n\"No,\" he says, almost puzzled. \"But they taste \\nfamiliar. Sugar berries?\" \\n\\n\"Well, you can\\'t get them in the market much, they \\nonly grow wild,\" I say. Another mouthful goes down. \\nJust one more to go. \\n\\n\"They\\'re sweet as syrup,\" he says, taking the last \\nspoonful. \"Syrup.\" His eyes widen as he realizes the \\n263 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ntruth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose \\nhard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries \\nto make himself vomit the stuff up, but it\\'s too late, \\nhe\\'s already losing consciousness. Even as he fades \\naway, I can see in his eyes what I\\'ve done is \\nunforgivable. \\n\\nI sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture \\nof sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his \\nchin and I wipe it away. \"Who can\\'t lie, Peeta?\" I say, \\neven though he can\\'t hear me. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter. The rest of Panem can. \\n\\n\\n\\n264 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIn the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks \\nand do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. \\nIt\\'s a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of \\nsweating and shifting things around, I\\'m pretty \\npleased with my work, The cave now appears to be \\npart of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the \\nvicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small \\nopening, but it\\'s undetectable from the out\\xc2\\xab side. \\nThat\\'s good, because I\\'ll need to share that sleeping \\nbag again tonight. Also, if I don\\'t make it back from \\nthe feast, Peeta will be hidden but not entirely \\nimprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much \\nlonger without medicine. If I die at the feast, District \\n12 isn\\'t likely to have a victor. \\n\\nI make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that \\ninhabit the stream down here, fill every water \\ncontainer and purify it, and clean my weapons. I\\'ve \\nnine arrows left in all. I debate leaving the knife with \\nPeeta so hell have some protection while I\\'m gone, \\nbut there\\'s really no point. He was right about \\ncamouflage being his final defense. But I still might \\nhave use for the knife. Who knows what 111 \\nencounter? \\n\\nHere are some things I\\'m fairly certain of. That at \\nleast Cato, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when \\nthe feast starts. I\\'m not sure about Foxface since \\ndirect confrontation isn\\'t her style or her forte. She\\'s \\neven smaller than I am and unarmed, unless she\\'s \\npicked up some weapons recently. Shell probably be \\nhanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can \\nscavenge. But the other three ... I\\'m going to have my \\nhands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my \\ngreatest asset, but I know 111 have to go right into the \\n265 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthick of things to get that backpack, the one with the \\nnumber 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith \\nmentioned. \\n\\nI watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at \\ndawn, but nobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there \\nwill be faces up there. Feasts always result in \\nfatalities. \\n\\nI crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up \\nnext to Peeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep \\ntoday. I have to stay awake. I don\\'t really think \\nanyone will attack our cave tonight, but I can\\'t risk \\nmissing the dawn. \\n\\nSo cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the \\nGamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air \\nacross the arena, which may be exactly what they\\'ve \\ndone. I lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb \\nevery bit of his fever heat. It\\'s strange to be so \\nphysically close to someone who\\'s so distant. Peeta \\nmight as well be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, \\nor on the moon right now, he\\'d be no harder to reach. \\nI\\'ve never felt lonelier since the Games began. \\n\\nJust accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not \\nto, but I can\\'t help thinking of my mother and Prim, \\nwondering if they\\'ll sleep a wink tonight. At this late \\nstage in the Games, with an important event like the \\nfeast, school will probably be canceled. My family can \\neither watch on that static-filled old clunker of a \\ntelevision at home or join the crowds in the square to \\nwatch on the big, clear screens, They\\'ll have privacy \\nat home but support in the square. People will give \\nthem a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I \\nwonder if the baker has sought them out, especially \\nnow that Peeta and I are a team, and made good on \\nhis promise to keep my sister\\'s belly full. \\n\\n\\n\\n266 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nSpirits must be running high in District 12. We so \\nrarely have anyone to root for at this point in the \\nGames. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and \\nme, especially now that we\\'re together. If I close my \\neyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging \\nus on. I see their faces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Greasy Sac and Madge and \\neven the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for \\nus. \\n\\nAnd Gale. I know him. He won\\'t be shouting and \\ncheering. But he\\'ll be watching, every moment, every \\ntwist and turn, and willing me to come home. I \\nwonder if he\\'s hoping that Peeta makes it as well. \\nGale\\'s not my boyfriend, but would he be, if I opened \\nthat door? He talked about us running away together. \\nWas that just a practical calculation of our chances of \\nsurvival away from the district? Or something more? \\n\\nI wonder what he makes of all this kissing. \\n\\nThrough a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross \\nthe sky. At what I judge to be about three hours \\nbefore dawn, I begin final preparations. I\\'m careful to \\nleave Peeta with water and the medical kit right \\nbeside him. Nothing else will be of much use if I don\\'t \\nreturn, and even these would only prolong his life a \\nshort time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket \\nand zip it on over my own. He doesn\\'t need it. Not \\nnow in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the \\nday, if I\\'m not there to remove it, hell be roasting in \\nit. My hands are already stiff from cold, so I take \\nRue\\'s spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and \\nthumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill her \\nsmall pack with some food, a water bottle, and \\nbandages, tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and \\narrows. I\\'m about to leave when I remember the \\nimportance of sustaining the star-crossed lover \\nroutine and I lean over and give Peeta a long, \\nlingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating \\n267 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of \\nmy own. Then I squeeze through the opening in the \\nrocks out into the night. \\n\\nMy breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. \\nIt\\'s as cold as a November night at home. One where \\nI\\'ve slipped into the woods, lantern in hand, to join \\nGale at some prearranged place where well sit \\nbundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks \\nwrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way \\nas the morning comes on. Oh, Gale, I think. If only \\nyou had my back now . . . \\n\\nI move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite \\nremarkable, but I still sorely miss having the use of \\nmy left ear. I don\\'t know what the explosion did, but it \\ndamaged something deep and irreparable. Never \\nmind. If I get home, 111 be so stinking rich, 111 be able \\nto pay someone to do my hearing. \\n\\nThe woods always look different at night. Even with \\nthe glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. \\nAs if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had \\ngone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions \\nof themselves to take their places. I don\\'t try anything \\ntricky, like taking a new route. I make my way back \\nup the stream and follow the same path back to Rue\\'s \\nhiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see no \\nsign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a \\nquiver of a branch. Either I\\'m the first to arrive or the \\nothers positioned themselves last night. There\\'s still \\nmore than an hour, maybe two, when I wriggle into \\nthe underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to \\nflow. \\n\\nI chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isn\\'t up for \\nmuch more. Thank goodness, I have Peeta\\'s jacket as \\nwell as my own. If not, I\\'d be forced to move around to \\nstay warm. The sky turns a misty morning gray and \\n\\n268 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nstill there\\'s no sign of the other tributes. It\\'s not \\nsurprising really. Everyone has distinguished \\nthemselves either by strength or deadliness or \\ncunning. Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta \\nwith me? I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he \\nwas wounded. All the better if they think he\\'s covering \\nme when I go in for the backpack. \\n\\nBut where is it? The arena has lightened enough for \\nme to remove my glasses. I can hear the morning \\nbirds singing. Isn\\'t it time? For a second, I\\'m \\npanicked that I\\'m at the wrong location. But no, I\\'m \\ncertain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying \\nthe Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So \\nwhere\\'s my feast? \\n\\nJust as the first ray of sun glints off the gold \\nCornucopia, there\\'s a disturbance on the plain. The \\nground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and \\na round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the \\narena. On the table sit four backpacks, two large \\nblack ones with the numbers 2and 11, a medium-size \\ngreen one with the number 5, and a tiny orange one \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 really I could carry it around my wrist \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that must \\nbe marked with a. 12. \\n\\nThe table has just clicked into place when a figure \\ndarts out of the Cornucopia, snags the green \\nbackpack, and speeds off. Foxface! Leave it to her to \\ncome up with such a clever and risky idea! The rest of \\nus are still poised around the plain, sizing up the \\nsituation, and she\\'s got hers. She\\'s got us trapped, \\ntoo, because no one wants to chase her down, not \\nwhile their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. \\nFoxface must have purposefully left the other packs \\nalone, knowing that to steal one without her number \\nwould definitely bring on a pursuer. That should have \\nbeen my strategy! By the lime I\\'ve worked through the \\nemotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and \\n269 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfrustration, I\\'m watching that reddish mane of hair \\ndisappear into the trees well out of shooting range. \\nHuh. I\\'m always dreading the others, but maybe \\nFoxface is the real opponent here. \\n\\nShe\\'s cost me time, too, because by now it\\'s clear that \\nI must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to \\nit will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without \\nhesitation, I sprint for the table. I can sense the \\nemergence of danger before I see it. Fortunately, the \\nfirst knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can \\nhear it and I\\'m able to deflect it with my bow. I turn, \\ndrawing back the bowstring and send an arrow \\nstraight at Clove\\'s heart. She turns just enough to \\navoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper \\nleft arm. Unfortunately, she throws with her right, \\nbut it\\'s enough to slow her down a few moments, \\nhaving to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the \\nseverity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning the \\nnext arrow automatically, as only someone who has \\nhunted for years can do. \\n\\nI\\'m at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny \\norange backpack. My hand slips between the straps \\nand I yank it up on my arm, it\\'s really too small to fit \\non any other part of my anatomy, and I\\'m turning to \\nfire again when the second knife catches me in the \\nforehead. It slices above my right eyebrow, opening a \\ngash that sends a gush running down my face, \\nblinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, \\nmetallic taste of my own blood. I stagger backward \\nbut still manage to send my readied arrow in the \\ngeneral direction of my assailant. I know as it leaves \\nmy hands it will miss. And then Clove slams into me, \\nknocking me flat on my back, pinning my shoulders \\nto the ground, with her knees. \\n\\nThis is it, I think, and hope for Prim\\'s sake it will be \\nfast. But Clove means to savor the moment. Even \\n\\n\\n\\n270 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfeels she has time. No doubt Cato is somewhere \\nnearby, guarding her, waiting for Thresh and possibly \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\"Where\\'s your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still \\nhanging on?\" she asks. \\n\\nWell, as long as we\\'re talking I\\'m alive. \"He\\'s out there \\nnow. Hunting Cato,\" I snarl at her. Then I scream at \\nthe top of my lungs. \"Peeta!\" \\n\\nClove jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively \\ncutting off my voice. But her head\\'s whipping from \\nside to side, and I know for a moment she\\'s at least \\nconsidering I\\'m telling the truth. Since no Peeta \\nappears to save me, she turns back to me. \\n\\n\"Liar,\" she says with a grin. \"He\\'s nearly dead. Cato \\nknows where he cut him. You\\'ve probably got him \\nstrapped up in some tree while you try to keep his \\nheart going. What\\'s in the pretty little backpack? That \\nmedicine for Lover Boy? Too bad he\\'ll never get it.\" \\n\\nClove opens her jacket. It\\'s lined with an impressive \\narray of knives. She carefully selects an almost \\ndainty- looking number with a cruel, curved blade. \"I \\npromised Cato if he let me have you, I\\'d give the \\naudience a good show.\" \\n\\nI\\'m struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but it\\'s \\nno use. She\\'s too heavy and her lock on me too tight. \\n\\n\"Forget it, District Twelve. We\\'re going to kill you. \\nJust like we did your pathetic little ally . . . what was \\nher name? The one who hopped around in the trees? \\nRue? Well, first Rue, then you, and then I think we\\'ll \\njust let nature take care of Lover Boy. How does that \\nsound?\" Clove asks. \"Now, where to start?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n271 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nShe carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound \\nwith her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my \\nface, tilting it from side to side as if it\\'s a block of \\nwood and she\\'s deciding exactly what pattern to carve \\non it. I attempt to bite her hand, but she grabs the \\nhair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the \\nground. \"I think ...\" she almost purrs. \"I think well \\nstart with your mouth.\" I clamp my teeth together as \\nshe teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip \\nof the blade. \\n\\nI won\\'t close my eyes. The comment about Rue has \\nfilled me with fury, enough fury I think to die with \\nsome dignity. As my last act of defiance, I will stare \\nher down as long as I can see, which will probably not \\nbe an extended period of time, but I will stare her \\ndown, I will not cry out. I will die, in my own small \\nway, undefeated. \\n\\n\"Yes, I don\\'t think youll have much use for your lips \\nanymore. Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss?\" she \\nasks, I work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and \\nspit it in her face. She flushes with rage. \"All right \\nthen. Let\\'s get started.\" \\n\\nI brace myself for the agony that\\'s sure to follow. But \\nas I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great \\nform yanks Clove from my body and then she\\'s \\nscreaming. I\\'m too stunned at first, too unable to \\nprocess what has happened. Has Peeta somehow \\ncome to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers sent in \\nsome wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft \\ninexplicably plucked her into the air? \\n\\nBut when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see \\nit\\'s none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the \\nground, imprisoned in Thresh\\'s arms. I let out a gasp, \\nseeing him like that, towering over me, holding Clove \\nlike a rag doll. I remember him as big, but he seems \\n272 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmore massive, more powerful than I even recall. If \\nanything, he seems to have gained weight in the \\narena. He flips Clove around and flings her onto the \\nground. \\n\\nWhen he shouts, I jump, never having heard him \\nspeak above a mutter. \"What\\'d you do to that little \\ngirl? You kill her?\" \\n\\nClove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a \\nfrantic insect, too shocked to even call for Cato. \"No! \\nNo, it wasn\\'t me!\" \\n\\n\"You said her name. I heard you. You kill her?\" \\nAnother thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his \\nfeatures. \"You cut her up like you were going to cut \\nup this girl here?\" \\n\\n\"No! No, I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" Clove sees the stone, about the size of a \\nsmall loaf of bread in Thresh\\'s hand and loses it. \\n\"Cato!\" she screeches. \"Cato!\" \\n\\n\"Clove!\" I hear Cato\\'s answer, but he\\'s too far away, I \\ncan tell that much, to do her any good. What was he \\ndoing? Trying to get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been \\nlying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his \\nlocation? \\n\\nThresh brings the rock down hard against Clove\\'s \\ntemple. It\\'s not bleeding, but I can see the dent in her \\nskull and I know that she\\'s a goner. There\\'s still life in \\nher now though, in the rapid rise and fall of her \\nchest, the low moan escaping her lips. \\n\\nWhen Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, I \\nknow it\\'s no good to run. And my bow is empty, the \\nlast loaded arrow having gone in Clove\\'s direction. I\\'m \\ntrapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes. \\n\"What\\'d she mean? About Rue being your ally?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n273 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. I tried \\nto save her, I did. But he got there first. District One,\" \\nI say. Maybe if he knows I helped Rue, he won\\'t \\nchoose some slow, sadistic end for me. \\n\\n\"And you killed him?\" he demands. \\n\\n\"Yes. I killed him. And buried her in flowers,\" I \\nsay. \"And I sang her to sleep.\" \\n\\nTears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes \\nout of me at the memory. And I\\'m overwhelmed by \\nRue, and the pain in my head, and my fear of Thresh, \\nand the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away. \\n\\n\"To sleep?\" Thresh says gruffly. \\n\\n\"To death. I sang until she died,\" I say. \"Your \\ndistrict... they sent me bread.\" My hand reaches up \\nbut not for an arrow that I know 111 never reach. Just \\nto wipe my nose. \"Do it fast, okay, Thresh?\" \\n\\nConflicting emotions cross Thresh\\'s face. He lowers \\nthe rock and points at me, almost accusingly. \"Just \\nthis one time, I let you go. For the little girl. You and \\nme, we\\'re even then. No more owed. You \\nunderstand?\" \\n\\nI nod because I do understand. About owing. About \\nhating it. I understand that if Thresh wins, he\\'ll have \\nto go back and face a district that has already broken \\nall the rules to thank me, and he is breaking the rules \\nto thank me, too. And I understand that, for the \\nmoment, Thresh is not going to smash in my skull. \\n\\n\"Clove!\" Cato\\'s voice is much nearer now. I can tell by \\nthe pain in it that he sees her on the ground. \\n\\n\"You better run now, Fire Girl,\" says Thresh. \\n\\n\\n\\n274 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dip \\ninto the hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh \\nand Clove and the sound of Cato\\'s voice. Only when I \\nreach the woods do I turn back for an instant. Thresh \\nand both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge \\nof the plain into the area I\\'ve never seen. Cato kneels \\nbeside Clove, spear in hand, begging her to stay with \\nhim. In a moment, he will realize it\\'s futile, she can\\'t \\nbe saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping \\naway the blood that\\'s pouring into my eye, fleeing like \\nthe wild, wounded creature I am. After a few minutes, \\nI hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died, \\nthat Cato will be on one of our trails. Either Thresh\\'s \\nor mine. I\\'m seized with terror, weak from my head \\nwound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can throw \\nthat spear almost as far as I can shoot. \\n\\nOnly one thing calms me down. Thresh has Cato\\'s \\nbackpack containing the thing he needs desperately. \\nIf I had to bet, Cato headed out after Thresh, not me. \\nStill I don\\'t slow down when I reach the water. I \\nplunge right in, boots still on, and flounder \\ndownstream. I pull off Rue\\'s socks that I\\'ve been \\nusing for gloves and press them into my forehead, \\ntrying to staunch the flow of blood, but they\\'re soaked \\nin minutes. \\n\\nSomehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze \\nthrough the rocks. In the dappled light, I pull the \\nlittle orange backpack from my arm, cut open the \\nclasp, and dump the contents on the ground. One \\nslim box containing one hypodermic needle. Without \\nhesitating, I jam the needle into Peeta\\'s arm and \\nslowly press down on the plunger. \\n\\nMy hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, \\nslick with blood. \\n\\n\\n\\n275 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful \\ngreen- and- silver moth landing on the curve of my \\nwrist. \\n\\n\\n\\n276 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house \\ngently pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to \\nreturn to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of \\nblankets, safe at home. I\\'m vaguely aware that my \\nhead aches. Possibly I have the flu and this is why I\\'m \\nallowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell I\\'ve been \\nasleep a long time. My mother\\'s hand strokes my \\ncheek and I don\\'t push it away as I would in \\nwakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I \\ncrave that gentle touch. How much I miss her even \\nthough I still don\\'t trust her. Then there\\'s a voice, the \\nwrong voice, not my mother\\'s, and I\\'m scared. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" it says. \"Katniss, can you hear me?\" \\n\\nMy eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I\\'m \\nnot home, not with my mother. I\\'m in a dim, chilly \\ncave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air \\ntainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The \\nhaggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after \\nan initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. \"Peeta.\" \\n\\n\"Hey,\" he says. \"Good to see your eyes again.\" \\n\\n\"How long have I been out?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were \\nlying next to me in a very scary pool of blood,\" he \\nsays. \"I think it\\'s stopped finally, but I wouldn\\'t sit up \\nor anything.\" \\n\\nI gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it \\nbandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and \\ndizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink \\nthirstily. \\n\\n277 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re better,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the \\ntrick,\" he says. \"By this morning, almost all the \\nswelling in my leg was gone.\" \\n\\nHe doesn\\'t seem angry about my tricking him, \\ndrugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I\\'m \\njust too beat-up and 111 hear about it later when I\\'m \\nstronger. But for the moment, he\\'s all gentleness. \\n\\n\"Did you eat?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that \\ngroosling before I realized it might have to last a \\nwhile. Don\\'t worry, I\\'m back on a strict diet,\" he says. \\n\\n\"No, it\\'s good. You need to eat. I\\'ll go hunting soon, \"I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Not too soon, all right?\" he says. \"You just let me \\ntake care of you for a while.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds \\nme bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink \\nplenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my \\nfeet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the \\nsleeping bag back up around my chin. \\n\\n\"Your boots and socks are still damp and the \\nweather\\'s not helping much,\" he says. There\\'s a clap \\nof thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky \\nthrough an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through \\nseveral holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort \\nof canopy over my head an upper body by wedging \\nthe square of plastic into the rock above me. \\n\\n\"I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who\\'s \\nthe target?\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n278 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cato and Thresh,\" I say without thinking. \"Foxface \\nwill be in her den somewhere, and Clove ... she cut \\nme an then ...\"My voice trails off. \\n\\n\"I know Clove\\'s dead. I saw it in the sky last night,\" he \\nsays. \"Did you kill her?\" \\n\\n\"No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Lucky he didn\\'t catch you, too,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nThe memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel \\nsick. \"He did. But he let me go.\" Then, of course, I \\nhave to tell him. About things I\\'ve kept to myself \\nbecause he was too sick to ask and I wasn\\'t ready to \\nrelive anyway. Like the explosion and my ear and \\nRue\\'s dying and the boy from District 1 and the \\nbread. All of which leads to what happened with \\nThresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts. \\n\\n\"He let you go because he didn\\'t want to owe you \\nanything?\" asks Peeta in disbelief. \\n\\n\"Yes. I don\\'t expect you to understand it. You\\'ve \\nalways had enough. But if you\\'d lived in the Seam, I \\nwouldn\\'t have to explain,\" I say. \\n\\n\"And don\\'t try. Obviously I\\'m too dim to get it.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s like the bread. How I never seem to get over \\nowing you for that,\" I say. \\n\\n\"The bread? What? From when we were kids?\" he \\nsays. \"I think we can let that go. I mean, you just \\nbrought me back from the dead.\" \\n\\n\"But you didn\\'t know me. We had never even spoken. \\nBesides, it\\'s the first gift that\\'s always the hardest to \\npay back. I wouldn\\'t even have been here to do it if \\n\\n\\n\\n279 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nyou hadn\\'t helped me then,\" I say. \"Why did you, \\nanyway?\" \\n\\n\"Why? You know why,\" Peeta says. I give my head a \\nslight, painful shake. \"Haymitch said you would take \\na lot of convincing.\" \\n\\n\"Haymitch?\" I ask. \"What\\'s he got to do with it?\" \\n\\n\"Nothing,\" Peeta says. \"So, Cato and Thresh, huh? I \\nguess it\\'s too much to hope that they\\'ll \\nsimultaneously destroy each other?\" \\n\\nBut the thought only upsets me. \"I think we would \\nlike Thresh. I think he\\'d be our friend back in District \\nTwelve,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Then let\\'s hope Cato kills him, so we don\\'t have \\nto, \"says Peeta grimly. \\n\\nI don\\'t want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I don\\'t want \\nanyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind \\nof thing that victors go around saying in the arena. \\nDespite my best efforts, I can feel tears starting to \\npool in my eyes. \\n\\nPeeta looks at me in concern. \"What is it? Are you in \\na lot of pain?\" \\n\\nI give him another answer, because it is equally true \\nbut can be taken as a brief moment of weakness \\ninstead of a terminal one. \"I want to go home, Peeta,\" \\nI say plaintively, like a small child. \\n\\n\"You will. I promise,\" he says, and bends over to give \\nme a kiss. \\n\\n\"I want to go home now,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n280 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of \\nhome. And you 11 be there for real before you know \\nit/\\'lie says. \"Okay?\" \\n\\n\"Okay,\" I whisper. \"Wake me if you need me to keep \\nwatch.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. \\nBesides, who knows how long this will last?\" he says. \\n\\nWhat does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii \\nbrings us? The Games themselves? I don\\'t know, but \\nI\\'m ion sad and tired to ask. \\n\\nIt\\'s evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has \\nturned to a downpour, sending streams of water \\nthrough our ceiling where earlier there had been only \\ndrips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst \\none and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it \\nfrom me. I feel a bit better, able to sit up without \\ngetting too dizzy, and I\\'m absolutely famished. So is \\nPeeta. It\\'s clear he\\'s been waiting for me to wake up to \\neat and is eager to get started. \\n\\nThere\\'s not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small \\nmishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit. \\n\\n\"Should we try and ration it?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"No, let\\'s just finish it. The groosling\\'s getting old \\nanyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick \\noffspoilt food,\" I say, dividing the food into two equal \\npiles. We tryand eat slowly, but we\\'re both so hungry \\nwere done in a couple of minutes. My stomach is in \\nno way satisfied. \"Tomorrow\\'s a hunting day,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I won\\'t be much help with that,\" Peeta says. \"I\\'ve \\nnever hunted before.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n281 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll kill and you cook,\" I say. \"And you can always \\ngather.\" \\n\\n\"I wish there was some sort of bread bush out \\nthere, \"says Peeta. \\n\\n\"The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still \\nwarm,\" I say with a sigh. \"Here, chew these.\" I hand \\nhim a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own \\nmouth. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it\\'s \\nclear enough to know there were no more deaths \\ntoday. So Cato and Thresh haven\\'t had it out yet. \\n\\n\"Where did Thresh go? I mean, what\\'s on the far side \\nof the circle?\" I ask Peeta. \\n\\n\"A field. As far as you can see it\\'s full of grasses as \\nhigh as my shoulders. I don\\'t know, maybe some of \\nthem are grain. There are patches of different colors. \\nBut there are no paths, \"says Peeta. \\n\\n\"I bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows \\nwhich ones, too,\" I say. \"Did you go in there?\" \\n\\n\"No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in \\nthat grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I \\nlook at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. \\nSnakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand,\" Peeta \\nsays. \"There could be anything in there.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t say so but Peeta\\'s words remind me of the \\nwarnings they give us about not going beyond the \\nfence in District 12.1 can\\'t help, for a moment, \\ncomparing him with Gale, who would see that field as \\na potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh \\ncertainly did. It\\'s not that Peeta\\'s soft exactly, and \\nhe\\'s proved he\\'s not a coward. But there are things \\n\\n\\n\\n282 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nyou don\\'t question too much, I guess, when your \\nhome always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale \\nquestions everything. What would Peeta think of the \\nirreverent banter that passes between us as we break \\nthe law each day? Would it shock him? The things we \\nsay about Panem? Gale\\'s tirades against the Capitol? \\n\\n\"Maybe there is a bread bush in that field,\" I \\n\\nsay. \"Maybe that\\'s why Thresh looks better fed now \\n\\nthan when we started the Games.\" \\n\\n\"Either that or he\\'s got very generous sponsors,\" says \\nPeeta. \"I wonder what we\\'d have to do to get Haymitch \\nto send us some bread.\" \\n\\nI raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn\\'t \\nknow about the message Haymitch sent us a couple \\nof nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. It\\'s \\nnot the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my \\nthoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that \\nthe romance has been fabricated to play on their \\nsympathies and that would result in no food at all. \\nSomehow, believably, I\\'ve got to get things back on \\ntrack. Something simple to start with. I reach out and \\ntake his hand. \\n\\n\"Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping \\nme knock you out,\" I say mischievously. \\n\\n\"Yeah, about that,\" says Peeta, entwining his fingers \\nin mine. \"Don\\'t try something like that again.\" \\n\\n\"Or what?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Or ... or ...\" He can\\'t think of anything good. \"Just \\ngive me a minute.\" \\n\\n\"What\\'s the problem?\" I say with a grin. \\n\\n\\n\\n283 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"The problem is we\\'re both still alive. Which only \\nreinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right \\nthing,\"says Peeta. \\n\\n\"I did do the right thing,\" I say. \\n\\n\"No! Just don\\'t, Katniss!\" His grip tightens, hurting \\nmy hand, and there\\'s real anger in his voice. \"Don\\'t \\ndie for me. You won\\'t be doing me any favors. All \\nright?\" \\n\\nI\\'m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent \\nopportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. \\n\"Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of \\nthat? Maybe you aren\\'t the only one who . . . who \\nworries about ... what it would be like if...\" \\n\\nI fumble. I\\'m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And \\nwhile I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta \\nhit me again and I realized how much I don\\'t want \\nhim to die. And it\\'s not about the sponsors. And it\\'s \\nnot about what will happen back home. And it\\'s not \\njust that I don\\'t want to be alone. It\\'s him. I do not \\nwant to lose the boy with the bread. \\n\\n\"If what, Katniss?\" he says softly. \\n\\nI wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out \\nthis moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it \\nmeans losing food. Whatever I\\'m feeling, it\\'s no one\\'s \\nbusiness but mine. \\n\\n\"That\\'s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to \\nsteer clear of,\" I say evasively, although Haymitch \\nnever said anything of the kind. In fact, he\\'s probably \\ncursing me out right now for dropping the ball during \\nsuch an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta \\nsomehow catches it. \\n\\n\\n\\n284 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then 111 just have to fill in the blanks myself,\" he \\nsays, and moves in to me. \\n\\nThis is the first kiss that we\\'re both fully aware of. \\nNeither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply \\nunconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or \\nicy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel \\nstirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is \\nthe first kiss that makes me want another. \\n\\nBut I don\\'t get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it\\'s \\njust a light one on the tip of my nose because Peeta\\'s \\nbeen distracted. \"I think your wound is bleeding \\nagain. Come on, lie down, it\\'s bedtime anyway,\" he \\nsays. \\n\\nMy socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta \\nput his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut \\nright down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. I \\ninsist on taking the first watch, too, although neither \\nof us think it\\'s likely anyone will come in this \\nweather. But he won\\'t agree unless I\\'m in the bag, \\ntoo, and I\\'m shivering so hard that it\\'s pointless to \\nobject. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt \\nPeeta was a million miles away, I\\'m struck by his \\nimmediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head \\ndown to use his arm as a pillow, the other rests \\nprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No \\none has held me like this in such a long time. Since \\nmy father died and I stopped trusting my mother, no \\none else\\'s arms have made me feel this safe. \\n\\nWith the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of \\nwater splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. \\nSeveral times, I drift off briefly and then snap awake, \\nguilty and angry with myself. After three or four \\nhours, I can\\'t help it, I have to rouse Peeta because I \\ncan\\'t keep my eyes open. He doesn\\'t seem to mind. \\n\\n\\n\\n285 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tomorrow, when it\\'s dry, 111 find us a place so high \\nin the trees we can both sleep in peace,\" I promise as \\nI drift off. \\n\\nBut tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The \\ndeluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on \\nwashing us all away. The thunder\\'s so powerful it \\nseems to shake the ground. Peeta\\'s considering \\nheading out anyway to scavenge for food, but I tell \\nhim in this storm it would be pointless. He won\\'t be \\nable to see three feet in front of his face and hell only \\nend up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He \\nknows I\\'m right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is \\nbecoming painful. \\n\\nThe day drags on turning into evening and there\\'s no \\nbreak in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but \\nnothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\neverything will cost an exorbitant amount \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or \\nbecause he\\'s dissatisfied with our performance. \\nProbably the latter. I\\'d be the first to admit we\\'re not \\nexactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, \\ntrying not to reopen wounds. We\\'re sitting huddled \\ntogether wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly \\nto keep warm. The most exciting thing either of us \\ndoes is nap. \\n\\nI\\'m not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The \\nkiss last night was nice, but working up to another \\nwill take some forethought. There are girls in the \\nSeam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate \\nthese waters so easily. But I\\'ve never had much time \\nor use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn\\'t enough \\nanymore clearly because if it was we\\'d have gotten \\nfood last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn\\'t \\njust looking for physical affection, he wants \\nsomething more personal. The sort of stuff he was \\ntrying to get me to tell about myself when we were \\npracticing for the interview. I\\'m rotten at it, but \\n286 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta\\'s not. Maybe the best approach is to get him \\ntalking. \\n\\n\"Peeta,\" I say lightly. \"You said at the interview you\\'d \\nhad a crush on me forever. When did forever start?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, let\\'s see. I guess the first day of school. We were \\nfive. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair ... it \\nwas in two braids instead of one. My father pointed \\nyou out when we were waiting to line up,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Your father? Why?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"He said, \\'See that little girl? I wanted to marry her \\nmother, but she ran off with a coal miner,\\'\" Peeta \\nsays. \\n\\n\"What? You\\'re making that up!\" I exclaim. \\n\\n\"No, true story,\" Peeta says. \"And I said, \\'A coal \\nminer? Why did she want a coal miner if she could Ve \\nhad you?\\' And he said, \\'Because when he sings ... \\neven the birds stop to listen.\\'\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s true. They do. I mean, they did,\" I say. I\\'m \\nstunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the \\nbaker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own \\nreluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might \\nnot really be that I think it\\'s a waste of time. It might \\nbe because it reminds me too much of my father. \\n\\n\"So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked \\nwho knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in \\nthe air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing \\nit for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows \\nfell silent,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Oh, please,\" I say, laughing. \\n\\n\\n\\n287 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I \\nknew \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just like your mother \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I was a goner,\" Peeta \\nsays. \"Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work \\nup the nerve to talk to you.\" \\n\\n\"Without success,\" I add. \\n\\n\"Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn \\nin the reaping was a real piece of luck,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nFor a moment, I\\'m almost foolishly happy and then \\nconfusion sweeps over me. Because we\\'re supposed to \\nbe making up this stuff, playing at being in love not \\nactually being in love. But Peeta\\'s story has a ring of \\ntruth to it. That part about my father and the birds. \\nAnd I did sing the first day of school, although I don\\'t \\nremember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . there \\nwas one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to \\nrags after my father\\'s death. \\n\\nIt would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a \\nbeating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. \\nSo, if those details are true ... could it all be true? \\n\\n\"You have a ... remarkable memory,\" I say haltingly. \\n\\n\"I remember everything about you,\" says Peeta, \\ntucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. \"You\\'re \\nthe one who wasn\\'t paying attention.\" \\n\\n\"I am now,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t have much competition here,\" he says. \\n\\nI want to draw away, to close those shutters again, \\nbut I know I can\\'t. It\\'s as if I can hear Haymitch \\nwhispering in my ear, \"Say it! Say it!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n288 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI swallow hard and get the words out. \"You don\\'t have \\nmuch competition anywhere.\" And this time, it\\'s me \\nwho leans in. \\n\\nOur lips have just barely touched when the clunk \\noutside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow \\nready to fly, but there\\'s no other sound. Peeta peers \\nthrough the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I \\ncan stop him, lie\\'s out in the rain, then handing \\nsomething in to me. A silver parachute attached to a \\nbasket. I rip it open at once and inside there\\'s a feast \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a \\ntureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The \\nvery dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most \\nimpressive thing the Capitol had to offer. \\n\\nPeeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. \\n\"I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us \\nstarve.\" \\n\\n\"I guess so,\" I answer. \\n\\nBut in my head I can hear Haymitch \\'s smug, if \\nslightly exasperated, words, \"Yes, that\\'s what I\\'m \\nlooking lot, sweetheart.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n289 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nEvery cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew \\nand cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But \\nPeeta\\'s voice stops me. \"We better take it slow on that \\nstew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich \\nfood made me sick and I wasn\\'t even starving then.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re right. And I could just inhale the whole \\nthing!\"I say regretfully. But I don\\'t. We are quite \\nsensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an \\negg- size serving of stew and rice. I make myself eat \\nthe stew in tiny spoonfuls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they even sent us \\nsilverware and plates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 savoring each bite. When we \\nfinish, I stare longingly at the dish. \"I want more.\" \\n\\n\"Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays \\ndown, then we get another serving,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Agreed,\" I say. \"It\\'s going to be a long hour.\" \\n\\n\"Maybe not that long,\" says Peeta. \"What was that \\nyou were saying just before the food arrived? \\nSomething about me ... no competition ... best thing \\nthat ever happened to you ...\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember that last part,\" I say, hoping it\\'s too \\ndim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush. \\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s right. That\\'s what / was thinking,\" he says. \\n\"Scoot over, I\\'m freezing.\" \\n\\nI make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean \\nback against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, \\nhis arms wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch \\nnudging me to keep up the act. \"So, since we were \\n\\n\\n\\n290 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nfive, you never even noticed any other girls?\" I ask \\nhim. \\n\\n\"No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them \\nmade a lasting impression but you,\" he says. \\n\\n\"I\\'m sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a \\ngirl from the Seam,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Hardly. But I couldn\\'t care less. Anyway, if we make \\nit back, you won\\'t be a girl from the Seam, you\\'ll be a \\ngirl from the Victor\\'s Village,\" he says. \\n\\nThat\\'s right. If we win, well each get a house in the \\npart of town reserved for Hunger Games\\' victors. Long \\nago, when the Games began, the Capitol had built a \\ndozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours \\nonly one is occupied. Most of the others have never \\nbeen lived in at all. \\n\\nA disturbing thought hits me. \"But then, our only \\nneighbor will be Haymitch!\" \\n\\n\"Ah, thatll be nice,\" says Peeta, tightening his arms \\naround me. \"You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. \\nPicnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire \\nretelling old Hunger Games \\'tales.\" \\n\\n\"I told you, he hates me!\" I say, but I can\\'t help \\nlaughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new \\npal. \\n\\n\"Only sometimes. When he\\'s sober, I\\'ve never heard \\nhim say one negative thing about you,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He\\'s never sober!\" I protest. \\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It\\'s \\nCinna who likes you. But that\\'s mainly because you \\n\\n\\n\\n291 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t try to run when he set you on fire,\" says Peeta. \\n\"On the other hand, Haymitch . . . well, if I were you, \\nI\\'d avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you.\" \\n\\n\"I thought you said I was his favorite,\" I say. \\n\\n\"He hates me more,\" says Peeta. \"I don\\'t think people \\nin general are his sort of thing.\" \\n\\nI know the audience will enjoy our having fun at \\nHaymitch\\'s expense. He has been around so long, \\nhe\\'s practically an old friend to some of them. And \\nafter his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, \\neverybody knows him. By this time, they\\'ll have \\ndragged him out of the control room for interviews \\nabout us. No telling what sort of lies he\\'s made up. \\nHe\\'s at something of a disadvantage because most \\nmentors have a partner, another victor to help them \\nwhereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at \\nany moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the \\narena. I wonder how he\\'s holding up, with the \\ndrinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to \\nkeep us alive. \\n\\nIt\\'s funny. Haymitch and I don\\'t get along well in \\nperson, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike \\nbecause he seems able to communicate with me by \\nthe timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be \\nclose to water when he withheld it and how I knew \\nthe sleep syrup just wasn\\'t something to ease Peeta\\'s \\npain and how I know now that I have to play up the \\nromance. He hasn\\'t made much effort to connect with \\nPeeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would \\njust be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I\\'ll see the \\nstrings attached to it. \\n\\nA thought hits me, and I\\'m amazed the question\\'s \\ntaken so long to surface. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'ve only \\n\\n\\n\\n292 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nrecently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of \\ncuriosity. \"How do you think he did it?\" \\n\\n\"Who? Did what?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?\" I \\nsay. \\n\\nPeeta considers this quite a while before he answers. \\nHaymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder \\nlike Cato or Thresh. He\\'s not particularly handsome. \\nNot in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on \\nyou. And he\\'s so surly, it\\'s hard to imagine anyone \\nteaming up with him. There\\'s only one way Haymitch \\ncould have won, and Peeta says it just as I\\'m reaching \\nthis conclusion myself. \\n\\n\"He outsmarted the others,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I\\'m \\nwondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to \\nhelp Peeta and me because he thought we just might \\nhave the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn\\'t always a \\ndrunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the \\ntributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to \\nmentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after \\nyear after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that \\nwill become my job. To mentor the girl from District \\n12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind. \\n\\nAbout half an hour has passed before I decide I have \\nto eat again. Peeta\\'s too hungry himself to put up an \\nargument. While I\\'m dishing up two more small \\nservings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem \\nbegin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack \\nin the rocks to watch the sky. \\n\\n\\n\\n293 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"There won\\'t be anything to see tonight,\" I say, far \\nmore interested in the stew than the sky. \"Nothing\\'s \\nhappened or we would\\'ve heard a cannon.\" \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" Peeta says quietly. \\n\\n\"What? Should we split another roll, too?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he repeats, but I find myself wanting to \\nignore him. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to split one. But 111 save the cheese for \\ntomorrow,\" I say. I see Peeta staring at me. \"What?\" \\n\\n\"Thresh is dead,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He can\\'t be,\" I say. \\n\\n\"They must have fired the cannon during the thunder \\nand we missed it,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Are you sure? I mean, it\\'s pouring buckets out there. \\nI don\\'t know how you can see anything,\" I say. I push \\nhim away from the rocks and squint out into the \\ndark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a \\ndistorted glimpse of Thresh\\'s picture and then he\\'s \\ngone. Just like that. \\n\\nI slump down against the rocks, momentarily \\nforgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I \\nshould be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And \\na powerful one, too. But I\\'m not happy. All I can think \\nabout is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because \\nof Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach... . \\n\\n\"You all right?\" asks Peeta. \\n\\nI give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my \\nhands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury \\n\\n\\n\\n294 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthe real pain because who\\'s going to bet on a tribute \\nwho keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. \\nRue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. \\nBut no one will understand my sorrow at Thresh\\'s \\nmurder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! \\nThankfully, I didn\\'t say it aloud. That\\'s not going to \\nwin me any points in the arena. What I do say is, \"It\\'s \\njust ... if we didn\\'t win ... I wanted Thresh to. Because \\nhe let me go. And because of Rue.\" \\n\\n\"Yeah, I know,\" says Peeta. \"But this means we\\'re one \\nstep closer to District Twelve.\" He nudges a plate of \\nfoot into my hands. \"Eat. It\\'s still warm.\" \\n\\nI take a bite of the stew to show I don\\'t really care, \\nbut it\\'s like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort \\nto swallow. \"It also means Cato will be back hunting \\nus.\" \\n\\n\"And he\\'s got supplies again,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Hell be wounded, I bet,\" I say. \\n\\n\"What makes you say that?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"Because Thresh would have never gone down \\nwithout a fight. He\\'s so strong, I mean, he was. And \\nthey were in his territory,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Good,\" says Peeta. \"The more wounded Cato is the \\nbetter. I wonder how Foxface is making out.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, she\\'s fine,\" I say peevishly. I\\'m still angry she \\nthought of hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn\\'t. \\n\"Probably be easier to catch Cato than her.\" \\n\\n\"Maybe theyH catch each other and we can just go \\nhome,\" says Peeta. \"But we better be extra careful \\nabout the watches. I dozed off a few times.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n295 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Me, too,\" I admit. \"But not tonight.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nWe finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to \\ntake the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping \\nbag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to \\nhide it from the cameras. I just need a few moments \\nof privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face \\nwithout being seen. Under the hood, I silently say \\ngood-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I \\npromise to remember him and, if I can, do something \\nto help his family and Rue\\'s, if I win. Then I escape \\ninto sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady \\nwarmth of Peeta beside me. \\n\\nWhen Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is \\nthe smell of goat cheese. He\\'s holding out half a roll \\nspread with the creamy white stuff and topped with \\napple slices. \"Don\\'t be mad,\" he says. \"I had to eat \\nagain. Here\\'s your half.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, good,\" I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The \\nstrong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim \\nmakes, the apples are sweet and crunchy. \"Mm.\" \\n\\n\"We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\n\"Bet that\\'s expensive,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless it\\'s gone \\nvery stale. Of course, practically everything we eat is \\nstale, \"says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around \\nhim. In less than a minute, he\\'s snoring. \\n\\nHuh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft \\nlife. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. \\nBut there\\'s something kind of depressing about living \\n\\n\\n\\n296 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nyour life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no \\none else wanted. One thing about us, since I bring \\nour food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh \\nyou have to make sure it isn\\'t going to make a run for \\nit. \\n\\nSomewhere during my shift, the rain stops not \\ngradually but all at once. The downpour ends and \\nthere\\'s only the residual drippings of water from \\nbranches, the rush of the now overflowing stream \\nbelow us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even \\nwithout the glasses I can see outside. I can\\'t decide if \\nthe moon is real or merely a projection of the \\nGamemakers. I know it was full shortly before I left \\nhome. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into \\nthe late hours. \\n\\nHow long have I been gone? I\\'m guessing it\\'s been \\nabout two weeks in the arena, and there was that \\nweek of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon \\nhas completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly \\nwant it to be my moon, the same one I see from the \\nwoods around District 12. That would give me \\nsomething to cling to in the surreal world of the arena \\nwhere the authenticity of everything is to be doubted. \\n\\nFour of us left. \\n\\nFor the first time, I allow myself to truly think about \\nthe possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To \\nwealth. To my own house in the Victor\\'s Village. My \\nmother and Prim would live there with me. No more \\nfear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then ... \\nwhat? What would my life be like on a daily basis? \\nMost of it has been consumed with the acquisition of \\nfood. Take that away and I\\'m not really sure who I \\nam, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. I \\nthink of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his \\nlife become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most \\n\\n\\n\\n297 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nof his waking hours drunk. I don\\'t want to end up like \\nthat. \\n\\n\"But you won\\'t be alone,\" I whisper to myself. I have \\nmy mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And \\nthen ... I don\\'t want to think about then, when Prim \\nhas grown up, my mother passed away. I know 111 \\nnever marry, never risk bringing a child into the \\nworld. Because if there\\'s one thing being a victor \\ndoesn\\'t guarantee, it\\'s your children\\'s safety. My kids\\' \\nnames would go right into the reaping balls with \\neveryone else\\'s. And I swear I\\'ll never let that happen. \\n\\nThe sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the \\ncracks and illuminating Peeta\\'s face. Who will he \\ntransform into if we make it home? This perplexing, \\ngood-natured boy who can spin out lies so \\nconvincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be \\nhopelessly in love with me, and 111 admit it, there are \\nmoments when he makes me believe it myself? At \\nleast, we\\'ll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the \\nfact that we\\'ve saved each other\\'s lives in here. And \\nbeyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. \\nGood friends. Any thing beyond that though ... and I \\nfeel Gale\\'s gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all \\nthe way from District 12. \\n\\nDiscomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake \\nPeeta\\'s shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when \\nthey focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss. \\n\\n\"We\\'re wasting hunting time,\" I say when I finally \\nbreak away. \\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t call it wasting,\" he says giving a big \\nstretch as he sits up. \"So do we hunt on empty \\nstomachs to give us an edge?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n298 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not us,\" I say. \"We stuff ourselves to give us staying \\npower.\" \\n\\n\"Count me in,\" Peeta says. But I can see he\\'s \\nsurprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice \\nand hand a heaping plate to him. \"All this?\" \\n\\n\"Well earn it back today,\" I say, and we both plow \\ninto our plates. Even cold, it\\'s one of the best things \\nI\\'ve ever tasted. I abandon my fork and scrape up the \\nlast dabs of gravy with my finger. \"I can feel Effie \\nTrinket shuddering at my manners.\" \\n\\n\"Hey, Effie, watch this!\" says Peeta. He tosses his fork \\nover his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean \\nwith his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then \\nhe blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, \"We \\nmiss you, Effie!\" \\n\\nI cover his mouth with my hand, but I\\'m laughing. \\n\"Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave.\" \\n\\nHe grabs my hand away. \"What do I care? I\\'ve got you \\nto protect me now,\" says Peeta, pulling me to him. \\n\\n\"Come on,\" I say in exasperation, extricating myself \\nfrom his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. \\n\\nOnce we\\'re packed up and standing outside our cave, \\nour mood shifts to serious. It\\'s as though for the last \\nfew days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and \\nCato\\'s preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a \\nrespite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is \\nsunny and warm, we both sense we\\'re really back in \\nthe Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever \\nweapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it \\ninto his belt. My last seven arrows \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of the twelve I \\nsacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\n\\n\\n299 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nrattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I can\\'t afford to \\nlose any more. \\n\\n\"He\\'ll be hunting us by now,\" says Peeta. \"Cato isn\\'t \\none to wait for his prey to wander by.\" \\n\\n\"If he\\'s wounded \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" I begin. \\n\\n\"It won\\'t matter,\" Peeta breaks in. \"If he can move, \\nhe\\'s coming.\" \\n\\nWith all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by \\nseveral feet on either side. We stop there to replenish \\nour water. I check the snares I set days ago and come \\nup empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, I \\nhaven\\'t seen many animals or signs of them in this \\narea. \\n\\n\"If we want food, we better head back up to my old \\nhunting grounds,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do,\" \\nPeeta says. \\n\\n\"Keep an eye out,\" I say. \"Stay on the rocks as much \\nas possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. \\nAnd listen for both of us.\" It\\'s clear, at this point, that \\nthe explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for \\ngood. \\n\\nI\\'d walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, \\nbut I\\'m not sure Peeta\\'s leg could take the current. \\nAlthough the drugs have erased the infection, he\\'s \\nstill pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife \\ncut, but after three days the bleeding has stopped. I \\nwear a bandage around my head though, just in case \\nphysical exertion should bring it back. \\n\\n\\n\\n300 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAs we head up alongside the stream, we pass the \\nplace where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds \\nand mud. One good thing, between the downpour and \\nthe flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have \\nbeen wiped out. That means that, if need be, we can \\ncome back to our cave. Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t risk it \\nwith Cato after us. \\n\\nThe boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn \\nto pebbles, and then, to my relief, we\\'re back on pine \\nneedles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For \\nthe first time, I realize we have a problem. Navigating \\nthe rocky terrain with a bad leg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well, you\\'re \\nnaturally going to make some noise. But even on the \\nsmooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I \\nmeanloudloud, as if he\\'s stomping his feet or \\nsomething. I turn and look at him. \\n\\n\"What?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to move more quietly,\" I say. \"Forget about \\nCato, you\\'re chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile \\nradius.\" \\n\\n\"Really?\" he says. \"Sorry, I didn\\'t know.\" \\n\\nSo, we start up again and he\\'s a tiny bit better, but \\neven with only one working ear, he\\'s making me \\njump. \\n\\n\"Can you take your boots off?\" I suggest. \\n\\n\"Here?\" he asks in disbelief, as if I\\'d asked him to \\nwalk barefoot on hot coals or something. I have to \\nremind myself that he\\'s still not used to the woods, \\nthat it\\'s the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences \\nof District 12. I think of Gale, with his velvet tread. \\nIt\\'s eerie how little sound he makes, even when the \\nleaves have fallen and it\\'s a challenge to move at all \\n301 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nwithout chasing off the game. I feel certain he\\'s \\nlaughing back home. \\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say patiently. \"I will, too. That way well both \\nbe quieter.\" Like I was making any noise. So we both \\nstrip off our boots and socks and, while there\\'s some \\nimprovement, I could swear he\\'s making an effort to \\nsnap every branch we encounter. \\n\\nNeedless to say, although it takes several hours to \\nreach my old camp with Rue, I\\'ve shot nothing. If the \\nstream would settle down, fish might be an option, \\nbut the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest \\nand drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, \\nI\\'d dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering \\nchore and go hunt, but then he\\'d be left with only a \\nknife to defend himself against Cato\\'s spears and \\nsuperior strength. So what I\\'d really like is to try and \\nconceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come \\nback and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn\\'t \\ngoing to go for that suggestion. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he says. \"We need to split up. I know I\\'m \\nchasing away the game.\" \\n\\n\"Only because your leg\\'s hurt,\" I say generously, \\nbecause really, you can tell that\\'s only a small part of \\nthe problem. \\n\\n\"I know,\" he says. \"So, why don\\'t you go on? Show me \\nsome plants to gather and that way well both be \\nuseful.\" \\n\\n\"Not if Cato comes and kills you.\" I tried to say it in a \\nnice way, but it still sounds like I think he\\'s a \\nweakling. \\n\\nSurprisingly, he just laughs. \"Look, I can handle \\nCato. I fought him before, didn\\'t I?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n302 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying \\nin a mud bank. That\\'s what I want to say, but I can\\'t. \\nHe did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try \\nanother tactic. \"What if you climbed up in a tree and \\nacted as a lookout while I hunted?\" I say, trying to \\nmake it sound like very important work. \\n\\n\"What if you show me what\\'s edible around here and \\ngo get us some meat?\" he says, mimicking my tone. \\n\"Just don\\'t go far, in case you need help.\" \\n\\nI sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need \\nfood, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of \\ncheese the size of a plum won\\'t last long. Ill just go a \\nshort distance and hope Cato is a long way off. \\n\\nI teach him a bird whistle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not a melody like Rue\\'s \\nbut a simple two-note whistle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we can use to \\ncommunicate that we\\'re all right. Fortunately, he\\'s \\ngood at this. Leaving him with the pack, I head off. \\n\\nI feel like I\\'m eleven again, tethered not to the safety \\nof the fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, \\nmaybe thirty yards of hunting space. Away from him \\nthough, the woods come alive with animal sounds. \\nReassured by his periodic whistles, I allow myself to \\ndrift farther away, and soon have two rabbits and a \\nfat squirrel to show for it. I decide it\\'s enough. I can \\nset snares and maybe get some fish. With Peeta\\'s \\nroots, this will be enough for now. \\n\\nAs I travel the short distance back, I realize we \\nhaven\\'t exchanged signals in a while. When my \\nwhistle receives no response, I run. In no time, I find \\nthe pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of \\nplastic has been laid on the ground where the sun \\ncan reach the single layer of berries that covers it. \\nBut where is he? \\n\\n\\n\\n303 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Peeta!\" I call out in a panic. \"Peeta!\" I turn to the \\nrustle of brush and almost send an arrow through \\nhim. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second \\nand it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps \\nback, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage. \\n\\nMy fear comes out as anger. \"What are you doing? \\nYou\\'re supposed to be here, not running around in \\nthe woods!\" \\n\\n\"I found some berries down by the stream,\" he says, \\nclearly confused by my outburst. \\n\\n\"I whistled. Why didn\\'t you whistle back?\"Isnap at \\nhim. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t hear. The water\\'s too loud, I guess,\" he says. \\nHe crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. \\nThat\\'s when I feel that I\\'m trembling. \\n\\n\"I thought Cato killed you!\" I almost shout. \\n\\n\"No, I\\'m fine.\" Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I \\ndon\\'t respond. \"Katniss?\" \\n\\nI push away, trying to sort out my feelings. \"If two \\npeople agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because \\nif one of them doesn\\'t answer, they\\'re in trouble, all \\nright?\" \\n\\n\"All right!\" he says. \\n\\n\"All right. Because that\\'s what happened with Rue, \\nand I watched her die!\" I say. I turn away from him, \\ngo to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, \\nalthough I still have some in mine. But I\\'m not ready \\nto forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples \\nare untouched, but someone\\'s definitely picked away \\npart of the cheese. \"And you ate without me!\" I really \\n304 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t care, I just want something else to be mad \\nabout. \\n\\n\"What? No, I didn\\'t,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what ate the cheese,\" Peeta says slowly \\nand distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, \"but \\nit wasn\\'t me. I\\'ve been down by the stream collecting \\nberries. Would you care for some?\" \\n\\nI would actually, but I don\\'t want to relent too soon. I \\ndo walk over and look at them. I\\'ve never seen this \\ntype before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These \\naren\\'t Rue\\'s berries, although they resemble them. \\nNor do they match any I learned about in training. I \\nlean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between \\nmy fingers. \\n\\nMy father\\'s voice comes back to me. \"Not these, \\nKatniss. Never these. They\\'re nightlock. You 11 be dead \\nbefore they reach your stomach.\" \\n\\nJust then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting \\nPeeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his \\neyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or \\nso away. What\\'s left of Foxface\\'s emaciated body is \\nlifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in \\nthe sunlight. \\n\\nI should have known the moment I saw the missing \\ncheese... . \\n\\nPeeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a \\ntree. \"Climb. He\\'ll be here in a second. Well stand a \\nbetter chance fighting him from above.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n305 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI stop him, suddenly calm. \"No, Peeta, she\\'s your kill, \\nnot Cato\\'s.\" \\n\\n\"What? I haven\\'t even seen her since the first day,\" he \\nsays. \"How could I have killed her?\" \\n\\nIn answer, I hold out the berries. \\n\\n\\n\\n306 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIt takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How \\nFoxface stole the food from the supply pile before I \\nblew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive \\nbut not enough that anyone would notice it, how she \\nwouldn\\'t question the safely of berries we were \\npreparing to eat ourselves. \\n\\n\"I wonder how she found us,\" says Peeta. \"My fault, I \\nguess, if I\\'m as loud as you say.\" \\n\\nWe were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, \\nbut I try to be kind. \"And she\\'s very clever, Peeta. \\nWell, she was. Until you outfoxed her.\" \\n\\n\"Not on purpose. Doesn\\'t seem fair somehow. I mean, \\nwe would have both been dead, too, if she hadn\\'t \\neaten the berries first.\" He checks himself. \"No, of \\ncourse, we wouldn\\'t. You recognized them, didn\\'t \\nyou?\" \\n\\nI give a nod. \"We call them nightlock.\" \\n\\n\"Even the name sounds deadly,\" he says. \"I\\'m sorry, \\nKatniss. I really thought they were the same ones \\nyou\\'d gathered.\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t apologize. It just means we\\'re one step closer to \\nhome, right?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll get rid of the rest,\" Peeta says. He gathers up the \\nsheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, \\nand goes to toss them into the woods. \\n\\n\"Wait!\" I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to \\nthe boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls \\n307 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nof berries from the plastic. \"If they fooled Foxface, \\nmaybe they can fool Cato as well. If he\\'s chasing us or \\nsomething, we can act like we accidentally drop the \\npouch and if he eats them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"Then hello District Twelve,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" I say, securing the pouch to my belt. \\n\\n\"He\\'ll know where we are now,\" says Peeta. \"If he was \\nanywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, he\\'ll know \\nwe killed her and come after us.\" \\n\\nPeeta\\'s right. This could be just the opportunity \\nCato\\'s been waiting for. But even if we run now, \\nthere\\'s the meat to cook and our fire will be another \\nsign of our whereabouts. \"Let\\'s make a fire. Right \\nnow.\" I begin to gather branches and brush. \\n\\n\"Are you ready to face him?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"I\\'m ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we \\nhave the chance. If he knows we\\'re here, he knows. \\nBut he also knows there\\'s two of us and probably \\nassumes we were hunting Foxface. That means you\\'re \\nrecovered. And the fire means we\\'re not hiding, we\\'re \\ninviting him here. Would you show up?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Maybe not,\" he says. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the \\ndamp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and \\nsquirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking \\nin the coals. We take turns gathering greens and \\nkeeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I anticipated, \\nhe doesn\\'t make an appearance. \\n\\nWhen the food\\'s cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving \\n\\nus each a rabbit\\'s leg to eat as we walk. \\n\\n308 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI want to move higher into the woods, climb a good \\ntree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. \\n\"I can\\'t climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, \\nand I don\\'t think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet \\nabove the ground.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s not safe to stay in the open, Peeta,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Can\\'t we go back to the cave?\" he asks. \"It\\'s near \\nwater and easy to defend.\" \\n\\nI sigh. Several more hours of walking \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or should I \\nsay crashing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 through the woods to reach an area \\nwe\\'ll just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But \\nPeeta doesn\\'t ask for much. He\\'s followed my \\ninstructions all day and I\\'m sure if things were \\nreversed, he wouldn\\'t make me spend the night in a \\ntree. It dawns on me that I haven\\'t been very nice to \\nPeeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, \\nscreaming at him over disappearing. The playful \\nromance we had sustained in the cave has \\ndisappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with \\nthe threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has \\nprobably just about had it with me. And as for the \\naudience ... \\n\\nI reach up and give him a kiss. \"Sure. Let\\'s go back to \\nthe cave.\" \\n\\nHe looks pleased and relieved. \"Well, that was easy.\" \\n\\nI work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage \\nthe shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself \\nnow. \\n\\nWe toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be \\nsending off smoke for a few more hours, although I \\ndoubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we \\nreach the stream, I see the water has dropped \\n\\n\\n\\n309 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nconsiderably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so I \\nsuggest we walk back in it. Peeta\\'s happy to oblige \\nand since he\\'s a lot quieter in water than on land, it\\'s \\na doubly good idea. It\\'s a long walk back to the cave \\nthough, even going downward, even with the rabbit to \\ngive us a boost. We\\'re both exhausted by our hike \\ntoday and still way too underfed. I keep my bow \\nloaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the \\nstream seems strangely empty of creatures. \\n\\nBy the time we reach our destination, our feet are \\ndragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill \\nup our water bottles and climb the little slope to our \\nden. It\\'s not much, but out here in the wilderness, it\\'s \\nthe closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer \\nthan a tree, too, because it provides some shelter \\nfrom the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from \\nthe west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through \\nPeeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the \\nhunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping \\nbag and set aside the rest of his food for when he \\nwakes. He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping \\nbag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the \\naudience, but for me. Because I\\'m so grateful that \\nhe\\'s still here, not dead by the stream as I\\'d thought. \\nSo glad that I don\\'t have to face Cato alone. \\n\\nBrutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist \\nof his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, \\nwho has had it out for me since the beginning. He \\nprobably has had a special hatred for me ever since I \\noutscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would \\nsimply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it drove \\nCato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of \\nhis ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown \\nup. The others were upset, of course, but he was \\ncompletely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not \\nbe entirely sane. \\n\\n\\n\\n310 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface \\nshine in the sky and then disappear from the world \\nforever. He hasn\\'t said it, but I don\\'t think Peeta felt \\ngood about killing her, even if it was essential. I can\\'t \\npretend I\\'ll miss her, but I have to admire her. My \\nguess is if they had given us some sort of test, she \\nwould have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in \\nfact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she\\'d \\nhave sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta\\'s \\nown ignorance that brought her down. I\\'ve spent so \\nmuch time making sure I don\\'t underestimate my \\nopponents that I\\'ve forgotten it\\'s just as dangerous to \\noverestimate them as well. \\n\\nThat brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had \\na sense of Foxface, who she was and how she \\noperated, he\\'s a little more slippery. Powerful, well \\ntrained, but smart? I don\\'t know. Not like she was. \\nAnd utterly lacking in the control Foxface \\ndemonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his \\njudgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel \\nsuperior on that point. I think of the moment I sent \\nthe arrow flying into the apple in the pig\\'s mouth \\nwhen I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato \\nbetter than I think. \\n\\nDespite the fatigue in my body, my mind\\'s alert, so I \\nlet Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a \\nsoft gray day has begun when I shake his shoulder. \\nHe looks out, almost in alarm. \"I slept the whole \\nnight. That\\'s not fair, Katniss, you should have woken \\nme.\" \\n\\nI stretch and burrow down into the bag. \"I\\'ll sleep \\nnow. Wake me if anything interesting happens.\" \\n\\nApparently nothing does, because when I open my \\neyes, bright hot afternoon light gleams through the \\nrocks. \"Any sign of our friend?\" I ask. \\n311 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta shakes his head. \"No, he\\'s keeping a \\ndisturbingly low profile.\" \\n\\n\"How long do you think well have before the \\nGamemakers drive us together?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there\\'s been \\nplenty of time for the audience to place bets and get \\nbored. I guess it could happen at any moment,\" says \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\"Yeah, I have a feeling today\\'s the day,\" I say. I sit up \\nand look out at the peaceful terrain. \"I wonder how \\nthey\\'ll do it.\" \\n\\nPeeta remains silent. There\\'s not really any good \\nanswer. \\n\\n\"Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting \\nday. But we should probably eat as much as we can \\nhold just in case we run into trouble,\" I say. \\n\\nPeeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. \\nThe rest of the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread \\nwith the last bit of cheese. The only thing I leave in \\nreserve is the squirrel and the apple. \\n\\nBy the time we\\'re done, all that\\'s left is a pile of rabbit \\nbones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my \\ngrowing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we don\\'t bathe \\ndaily in the Seam, but we keep cleaner than I have of \\nlate. Except for my feet, which have walked in the \\nstream, I\\'m covered in a layer of grime. \\n\\nLeaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I \\ndon\\'t think there will be another night in the arena \\nsomehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, I have \\nthe feeling 111 escape it today. I give the rocks a pat \\ngood-bye and we head down to the stream to wash \\n312 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nup. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I \\nmay do my hair and braid it back wet. I\\'m wondering \\nif we might even be able to give our clothes a quick \\nscrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be \\nthe stream. Now there\\'s only a bone-dry bed. I put my \\nhand down to feel it. \\n\\n\"Not even a little damp. They must have drained it \\nwhile we slept,\" I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, \\naching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my \\nprevious dehydration creeps into my consciousness. \\nOur bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two \\ndrinking and this hot sun it won\\'t take long to deplete \\nthem. \\n\\n\"The lake,\" says Peeta. \"That\\'s where they want us to \\ngo.\" \\n\\n\"Maybe the ponds still have some,\" I say hopefully. \\n\\n\"We can check,\" he says, but he\\'s just humoring me. \\nI\\'m humoring myself because I know what I\\'ll find \\nwhen we return to the pond where I soaked my leg. A \\ndusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip \\nanyway just to confirm what we already know. \\n\\n\"You\\'re right. They\\'re driving us to the lake,\" I say. \\nWhere there\\'s no cover. Where they\\'re guaranteed a \\nbloody fight to the death with nothing to block their \\nview. \"Do you want to go straightaway or wait until \\nthe water\\'s tapped out?\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s go now, while we\\'ve had food and rest. Let\\'s just \\ngo end this thing,\" he says. \\n\\nI nod. It\\'s funny. I feel almost as if it\\'s the first day of \\nthe Games again. That I\\'m in the same position. \\nTwenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to \\nkill Cato. And really, wasn\\'t he always the one to kill? \\n313 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nNow it seems the other tributes were just minor \\nobstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real \\nbattle of the Games. Cato and me. \\n\\nBut no, there\\'s the boy waiting beside me. I feel his \\narms wrap around me. \\n\\n\"Two against one. Should be a piece of cake,\" he says. \\n\"Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol,\" I answer. \\n\"You bet it will,\" he says. \\n\\nWe stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling \\neach other, the sunlight, the rustle of the leaves at \\nour feet. Then without a word, we break apart and \\nhead for the lake. \\n\\nI don\\'t care now that Peeta\\'s footfalls send rodents \\nscurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight \\nCato and I\\'d just as soon do it here as on the plain. \\nBut I doubt I\\'ll have that choice. If the Gamemakers \\nwant us in the open, then in the open we will be. \\n\\nWe stop to rest for a few moments under the tree \\nwhere the Careers trapped me. The husk of the \\ntracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy \\nrains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the \\nlocation. I touch it with the tip of my boot, and it \\ndissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the \\nbreeze. I can\\'t help looking up in the tree where Rue \\nsecretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker \\nj ackers. Glimmer\\'s bloated body. The terrifying \\nhallucinations ... \\n\\n\"Let\\'s move on,\" I say, wanting to escape the darkness \\nthat surrounds this place. Peeta doesn\\'t object. \\n\\n\\n\\n314 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nGiven our late start to the day, when we reach the \\nplain it\\'s already early evening. There\\'s no sign of \\nCato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia \\nglowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato \\ndecided to pull a Foxface on us, we circle the \\nCornucopia to make sure it\\'s empty. Then obediently, \\nas if following instructions, we cross to the lake and \\nfill our water containers. \\n\\nI frown at the shrinking sun. \"We don\\'t want to fight \\nhim after dark. There\\'s only the one pair of glasses.\" \\n\\nPeeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the \\nwater. \"Maybe that\\'s what he\\'s waiting for. What do \\nyou want to do? Go back to the cave?\" \\n\\n\"Either that or find a tree. But let\\'s give him another \\nhalf an hour or so. Then well take cover,\" I answer. \\n\\nWe sit by the lake, in full sight. There\\'s no point in \\nhiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can \\nsee the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies \\nback and forth between them like brightly colored \\nballs. I open my mouth and sing out Rue\\'s four-note \\nrun. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of \\nmy voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the \\nsilence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, \\nthen another. Then the whole world comes alive with \\nthe sound. \\n\\n\"Just like your father,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nMy fingers find the pin on my shirt. \"That\\'s Rue\\'s \\nsong,\" I say. \"I think they remember it.\" \\n\\nThe music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. \\nAs the notes overlap, they compliment one another, \\nforming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this \\nsound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard \\n\\n\\n\\n315 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nworkers of District 1 1 home each night. Does \\nsomeone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that \\nshe is dead? \\n\\nFor a while, I just close my eyes and listen, \\nmesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then \\nsomething begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off \\nin jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes intersperse \\nwith the melody. The mockingjays\\' voices rise up in a \\nshrieking cry of alarm. \\n\\nWe\\'re on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised \\nto shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and \\nbears down on us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands \\nare empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow \\nhits his chest and inexplicably falls aside. \\n\\n\"He\\'s got some kind of body armor!\" I shout to Peeta. \\n\\nJust in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace \\nmyself, but he rockets right between us with no \\nattempt to check his speed. I can tell from his \\npanting, the sweat pouring off his purplish face, that \\nhe\\'s been running hard a long time. Not toward us. \\nFrom something. But what? \\n\\nMy eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first \\ncreature leap onto the plain. As I\\'m turning away, I \\nsee another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling \\nblindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to \\nsave myself. \\n\\n\\n\\n316 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuttations. No question about it. I\\'ve never seen \\nthese mutts, but they\\'re no natural-born animals. \\nThey resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and \\nthen balances easily on its hind legs? What wolf \\nwaves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw \\nas though it had a wrist? These things I can see at a \\ndistance. Up close, I\\'m sure their more menacing \\nattributes will be revealed. \\n\\nCato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and \\nwithout question I follow him. If he thinks it\\'s the \\nsafest place, who am I to argue? Besides, even if I \\ncould make it to the trees, it would be impossible for \\nPeeta to outrun them on that leg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Peeta! My hands \\nhave just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of \\nthe Cornucopia when I remember I\\'m part of a team. \\nHe\\'s about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast \\nas he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast. I \\nsend an arrow into the pack and one goes down, but \\nthere are plenty to take its place. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s waving me up the horn, \"Go, Katniss! Go!\" \\n\\nHe\\'s right. I can\\'t protect either of us on the ground. I \\nstart climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands \\nand feet. The pure gold surface has been designed to \\nresemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so \\nthere are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold \\non. But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels \\nhot enough to blister my hands. \\n\\nCato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, \\ntwenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his \\nbreath as he gags over the edge. Now\\'s my chance to \\nfinish him off. I stop midway up the horn and load \\n317 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nanother arrow, but just as I\\'m about to let it fly, I \\nhear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see he\\'s just \\nreached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels. \\n\\n\"Climb!\" I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only \\nthe leg but the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow \\ndown the throat of the first mutt that places its paws \\non the metal. As it dies the creature lashes out, \\ninadvertently opening gashes on a few of its \\ncompanions. That\\'s when I get a look at the claws. \\nFour inches and clearly razor-sharp. \\n\\nPeeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull \\nhim along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top \\nand whip around, but he\\'s doubled over with cramps \\nand apparently more preoccupied with the mutts \\nthan us. He coughs out something unintelligible. The \\nsnuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts isn\\'t \\nhelping. \\n\\n\"What?\" I shout at him. \\n\\n\"He said, \\'Can they climb it?\\'\" answers Peeta, drawing \\nmy focus back to the base of the horn. \\n\\nThe mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join \\ntogether, they raise up again to stand easily on their \\nback legs giving them an eerily human quality. Each \\nhas a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and \\nsleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black \\nto what I can only describe as blond. There\\'s \\nsomething else about them, something that makes \\nthe hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can\\'t \\nput my finger on it. \\n\\nThey put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and \\ntasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and \\nthen making high-pitched yipping sounds to one \\nanother. This must be how they communicate \\n318 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nbecause the pack backs up as if to make room. Then \\none of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of \\nblond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the \\nhorn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful \\nbecause it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink \\nlips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs \\nthere, and in that moment I realize what else \\nunsettled me about the mutts. The green eyes \\nglowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any \\ncanine I\\'ve ever seen. They are unmistakably human. \\nAnd that revelation has barely registered when I \\nnotice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels \\nand the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, \\nthe green eyes, the number ... it\\'s Glimmer. \\n\\nA shriek escapes my lips and I\\'m having trouble \\nholding the arrow in place. I have been waiting to fire, \\nonly too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows. \\nWaiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But \\nnow, even though the mutt has begun to slide \\nbackward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, \\neven though I can hear the slow screeching of the \\nclaws like nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. \\nIts body twitches and flops onto the ground with a \\nthud. \\n\\n\"Katniss?\" I can feel Peeta\\'s grip on my arm. \\n\"It\\'s her!\" I get out. \\n\"Who?\" asks Peeta. \\n\\nMy head snaps from side to side as I examine the \\npack, taking in the various sizes and colors. The \\nsmall one with the red coat and amber eyes . . . \\nFoxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes of \\nthe boy from District 9 who died as we struggled for \\nthe backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, \\nwith dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar \\n319 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthat reads 1 1 in woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. \\nRue ... \\n\\n\"What is it, Katniss?\" Peeta shakes my shoulder. \\n\\n\"It\\'s them. It\\'s all of them. The others. Rue and \\nFoxface and ... all of the other tributes,\" I choke out. \\n\\nI hear Peeta\\'s gasp of recognition. \"What did they do \\nto them? You don\\'t think . . . those could be their real \\neyes?\" \\n\\nTheir eyes are the least of my worries. What about \\ntheir brains? Have they been given any of the real \\ntributes memories? Have they been programmed to \\nhate our faces particularly because we have survived \\nand they were so callously murdered? And the ones \\nwe actually killed ... do they believe they\\'re avenging \\ntheir own deaths? \\n\\nBefore I can get this out, the mutts begin a new \\nassault on the horn. They\\'ve split into two groups at \\nthe sides of the horn and are using those powerful \\nhindquarters to launch themselves at us. A pair of \\nteeth ring together just inches from my hand and \\nthen I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, \\nthe heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the \\nside. If not for the grip on my arm, he\\'d be on the \\nground, but as it is, it takes all my strength to keep \\nus both on the curved back of the horn. And more \\ntributes are coming. \\n\\n\"Kill it, Peeta! Kill it!\" I\\'m shouting, and although I \\ncan\\'t quite see what\\'s happening, I know he must \\nhave stabbed the thing because the pull lessens. I\\'m \\nable to haul him back onto the horn where we drag \\nourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils \\nawaits. \\n\\n\\n\\n320 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nCato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing \\nis slowing and I know soon he\\'ll be recovered enough \\nto come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. \\nI arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a \\nmutt that can only be Thresh. Who else could jump \\nso high? I feel a moment\\'s relief because we must \\nfinally be up above the mutt line and I\\'m just turning \\nback to face Cato when Peeta\\'s jerked from my side. \\nI\\'m sure the pack has got him until his blood \\nsplatters my face. \\n\\nCato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, \\nholding Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his \\nair. Peeta\\'s clawing at Cato\\'s arm, but weakly, as if \\nconfused over whether it\\'s more important to breathe \\nor try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping \\nhole a mutt left in his calf. \\n\\nI aim one of my last two arrows at Cato\\'s head, \\nknowing it 11 have no effect on his trunk or limbs, \\nwhich I can now see are clothed in a skintight, flesh- \\ncolored mesh. Some high-grade body armor from the \\nCapitol. Was that what was in his pack at the feast? \\nBody armor to defend against my arrows? Well, they \\nneglected to send a face guard. \\n\\nCato just laughs. \"Shoot me and he goes down with \\nme.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s right. If I take him out and he falls to the mutts, \\nPeeta is sure to die with him. We\\'ve reached a \\nstalemate. I can\\'t shoot Cato without killing Peeta, \\ntoo. He can\\'t kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow \\nin his brain. We stand like statues, both of us seeking \\nan out. \\n\\nMy muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they \\nmight snap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the \\n\\n\\n\\n321 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nbreaking point. The mutts go silent and the only thing \\nI can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s lips are turning blue. If I don\\'t do something \\nquickly, hell die of asphyxiation and then 111 have \\nlost him and Cato will probably use his body as a \\nweapon against me. In fact, I\\'m sure this is Cato\\'s \\nplan because while he\\'s stopped laughing, his lips are \\nset in a triumphant smile. \\n\\nAs if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, \\ndripping with blood from his leg, up to Cato\\'s arm. \\nInstead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger \\nveers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of \\nCato\\'s hand. Cato realizes what it means exactly one \\nsecond after I do. I can tell by the way the smile drops \\nfrom his lips. But it\\'s one second too late because, by \\nthat time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out \\nand reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against \\nhim. For a horrible moment, I think they\\'re both going \\nover. I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as \\nCato loses his footing on the blood-slick horn and \\nplummets to the ground. \\n\\nWe hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, \\nand then the mutts attack him. Peeta and I hold on to \\neach other, waiting for the cannon, waiting for the \\ncompetition to finish, waiting to be released. But it \\ndoesn\\'t happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of \\nthe Hunger Games, and the audience expects a show. \\n\\nI don\\'t watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, \\nthe howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato \\ntakes on the mutt pack. I can\\'t understand how he \\ncan be surviving until I remember the body armor \\nprotecting him from ankle to neck and I realize what a \\nlong night this could be. Cato must have a knife or \\nsword or something, too, something he had hidden in \\nhis clothes, because on occasion there\\'s the death \\n\\n\\n\\n322 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nscream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as \\nthe blade collides with the golden horn. The combat \\nmoves around the side of the Cornucopia, and I know \\nCato must be attempting the one maneuver that \\ncould save his life \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to make his way back around to \\nthe tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, \\ndespite his remarkable strength and skill, he is \\nsimply overpowered. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how long it has been, maybe an hour or \\nso, when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts \\ndragging him, dragging him back into the \\nCornucopia. Now they\\'ll finish him off, I think. But \\nthere\\'s still no cannon. \\n\\nNight falls and the anthem plays and there\\'s no \\npicture of Cato in the sky, only the faint moans \\ncoming through the metal beneath us. The icy air \\nblowing across the plain reminds me that the Games \\nare not over and may not be for who knows how long, \\nand there is still no guarantee of victory. \\n\\nI turn my attention to Peeta and discover his leg is \\nbleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, \\nremain down by the lake where we abandoned them \\nwhen we fled from the mutts. I have no bandage, \\nnothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. \\nAlthough I\\'m shaking in the biting wind, I rip off my \\njacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket \\nas swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my \\nteeth chattering beyond control. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him \\nlie down before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery \\nblood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be \\nenough. I\\'ve seen my mother tie a tourniquet a \\nhandful of times and try to replicate it. I cut free a \\nsleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just \\nunder his knee, and tie a half knot. I don\\'t have a \\n\\n\\n\\n323 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nstick, so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in \\nthe knot, twisting it as tightly as I dare. It\\'s risky \\nbusiness \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Peeta may end up losing his leg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but \\nwhen I weigh this against him losing his life, what \\nalternative do I have? I bandage the wound in the rest \\nof my shirt and lay down with him. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t go to sleep,\" I tell him. I\\'m not sure if this is \\nexactly medical protocol, but I\\'m terrified that if he \\ndrifts off hell never wake again. \\n\\n\"Are you cold?\" he asks. He unzips his jacket and I \\npress against him as he fastens it around me. It\\'s a \\nbit warmer, sharing our body heat inside my double \\nlayer of jackets, but the night is young. The \\ntemperature will continue to drop. \\n\\nEven now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so \\nwhen I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice. \\n\\n\"Cato may win this thing yet,\" I whisper to Peeta. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t you believe it,\" he says, pulling up my hood, \\nbut he\\'s shaking harder than I am. \\n\\nThe next hours are the worst in my life, which if you \\nthink about it, is saying something. The cold would be \\ntorture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to \\nCato, moaning, begging, and finally just whimpering \\nas the mutts work away at him. After a very short \\ntime, I don\\'t care who he is or what he\\'s done, all I \\nwant is for his suffering to end. \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t they just kill him?\" I ask Peeta. \\n\\n\"You know why,\" he says, and pulls me closer to him. \\n\\n\\n\\n324 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I do. No viewer could turn away from the show \\nnow. From the Gamemakers\\' point of view, this is the \\nfinal word in entertainment. \\n\\nIt goes on and on and on and eventually completely \\nconsumes my mind, blocking out memories and \\nhopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the \\npresent, which I begin to believe will never change. \\nThere will never be anything but cold and fear and \\nthe agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn. \\n\\nPeeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I \\nfind myself yelling his name louder and louder \\nbecause if he goes and dies on me now, I know 111 go \\ncompletely insane. He\\'s fighting it, probably more for \\nme than for him, and it\\'s hard because \\nunconsciousness would be its own form of escape. \\nBut the adrenaline pumping through my body would \\nnever allow me to follow him, so I can\\'t let him go. I \\njust can\\'t. \\n\\nThe only indication of the passage of time lies in the \\nheavens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins \\npointing it out to me, insisting I acknowledge its \\nprogress and sometimes, for just a moment I feel a \\nflicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs \\nme again. \\n\\nFinally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I \\nopen my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale \\nlight of dawn. I can see, too, how bloodless Peeta\\'s \\nface has become. How little time he has left. And I \\nknow I have to get him back to the Capitol. \\n\\nStill, no cannon has fired. I press my good ear against \\nthe horn and can just make out Cato\\'s voice. \\n\\n\"I think he\\'s closer now. Katniss, can you shoot \\nhim?\"Peeta asks. \\n\\n\\n\\n325 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nIf he\\'s near the mouth, I may be able to take him out. \\nIt would be an act of mercy at this point. \\n\\n\"My last arrow\\'s in your tourniquet,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Make it count,\" says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, \\nletting me loose. \\n\\nSo I free the arrow, tying the tourniquet back as \\ntightly as my frozen fingers can manage. I rub my \\nhands together, trying to regain circulation. When I \\ncrawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge, I \\nfeel Peeta\\'s hands grip me for support. \\n\\nIt takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, \\nin the blood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to \\nbe my enemy makes a sound, and I know where his \\nmouth is. And I think the word he\\'s trying to say is \\nplease. \\n\\nPity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his \\nskull. Peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver \\nempty. \\n\\n\"Did you get him?\" he whispers. \\n\\nThe cannon fires in answer. \\n\\n\"Then we won, Katniss,\" he says hollowly. \\n\\n\"Hurray for us,\" I get out, but there\\'s no joy of victory \\nin my voice. \\n\\nA hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the \\nremaining mutts bound into it, disappearing as the \\nearth closes above them. \\n\\n\\n\\n326 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWe wait, for the hovercraft to take Cato\\'s remains, for \\nthe trumpets of victory that should follow, but \\nnothing happens. \\n\\n\"Hey!\" I shout into air. \"What\\'s going on?\" The only \\nresponse is the chatter of waking birds. \\n\\n\"Maybe it\\'s the body. Maybe we have to move away \\nfrom it,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself \\nfrom the dead tribute on the final kill? My brain is too \\nmuddled to be sure, but what else could be the \\nreason for the delay? \\n\\n\"Okay. Think you could make it to the lake?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Think I better try,\" says Peeta. We inch down to the \\ntail of the horn and fall to the ground. If the stiffness \\nin my limbs is this bad, how can Peeta even move? I \\nrise first, swinging and bending my arms and legs \\nuntil I think I can help him up. Somehow, we make it \\nback to the lake. I scoop up a handful of the cold \\nwater for Peeta and bring a second to my lips. \\n\\nA mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of \\nrelief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes \\nCato\\'s body away. Now they will take us. Now we can \\ngo home. \\n\\nBut again there\\'s no response. \\n\\n\"What are they waiting for?\" says Peeta weakly. \\nBetween the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it \\ntook to get to the lake, his wound has opened up \\nagain. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" I say. Whatever the holdup is, I can\\'t \\n\\nwatch him lose any more blood. I get up to find a \\n\\n327 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nstick but almost immediately come across the arrow \\nthat bounced off Cato\\'s body armor. It will do as well \\nas the other arrow. As I stoop to pick it up, Claudius \\nTemplesmith\\'s voice booms into the arena. \\n\\n\"Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy- \\nfourth Hunger Games. The earlier revision has been \\nrevoked. Closer examination of the rule book has \\ndisclosed that only one winner may be allowed,\" he \\nsays. \"Good luck and may the odds be ever in your \\nfavor.\" \\n\\nThere\\'s a small burst of static and then nothing more. \\nI stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They \\nnever intended to let us both live. This has all been \\ndevised by the Gamemakers to guarantee the most \\ndramatic showdown in history. And like a fool, I \\nbought into it. \\n\\n\"If you think about it, it\\'s not that surprising,\" he \\nsays softly. I watch as he painfully makes it to his \\nfeet. Then he\\'s moving toward me, as if in slow \\nmotion, his hand is pulling the knife from his belt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\nBefore I am even aware of my actions, my bow is \\nloaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. \\nPeeta raises his eyebrows and I see the knife has \\nalready left his hand on its way to the lake where it \\nsplashes in the water. I drop my weapons and take a \\nstep back, my face burning in what can only be \\nshame. \\n\\n\"No,\" he says. \"Do it.\" Peeta limps toward me and \\nthrusts the weapons back in my hands. \\n\\n\"I can\\'t, I say. \"I won\\'t.\" \\n\\n\"Do it. Before they send those mutts back or \\n\\nsomething. I don\\'t want to die like Cato,\" he says. \\n\\n328 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then you shoot me,\" I say furiously, shoving the \\nweapons back at him. \"You shoot me and go home \\nand live with it!\"And as I say it, I know death right \\nhere, right now would be the easier of the two. \\n\\n\"You know I can\\'t,\" Peeta says, discarding the \\nweapons. \"Fine, I\\'ll go first anyway.\" He leans down \\nand rips the bandage off his leg, eliminating the final \\nbarrier between his blood and the earth. \\n\\n\"No, you can\\'t kill yourself,\" I say. I\\'m on my knees, \\ndesperately plastering the bandage back onto his \\nwound. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he says. \"It\\'s what I want.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re not leaving me here alone,\" I say. Because if \\nhe dies, 111 never go home, not really. Ill spend the \\nrest of my life in this arena trying to think my way \\nout. \\n\\n\"Listen,\" he says pulling me to my feet. \"We both \\nknow they have to have a victor. It can only be one of \\nus. Please, take it. For me.\" And he goes on about \\nhow he loves me, what life would be without me but \\nI\\'ve stopped listening because his previous words are \\ntrapped in my head, thrashing desperately around. \\n\\nWe both know they have to have a victor. \\n\\nYes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the \\nwhole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers\\' faces. \\nThey\\'d have failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be \\nexecuted, slowly and painfully while the cameras \\nbroadcast it to every screen in the country. \\n\\nIf Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we \\nwere ... \\n\\n\\n\\n329 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nMy fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing \\nit. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. \\n\"No, I won\\'t let you.\" \\n\\n\"Trust me,\" I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long \\nmoment then lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch \\nand pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. \\nThen I fill my own. \"On the count of three?\" \\n\\nPeeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. \\n\"The count of three,\" he says. \\n\\nWe stand, our backs pressed together, our empty \\nhands locked tight. \\n\\n\"Hold them out. I want everyone to see,\" he says. \\n\\nI spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten \\nin the sun. I give Peeta\\'s hand one last squeeze as a \\nsignal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. \"One.\" \\nMaybe I\\'m wrong. \"Two. \"Maybe they don\\'t care if we \\nboth die. \"Three!\" It\\'s too late to change my mind. I lift \\nmy hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the \\nworld. The berries have just passed my lips when the \\ntrumpets begin to blare. \\n\\nThe frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts \\nabove them. \"Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am \\npleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth \\nHunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I \\ngive you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the tributes of District Twelve!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n330 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue \\nwith the end of my shirt to make sure no juice \\nremains. Peeta pulls me to the lake where we both \\nflush our mouths with water and then collapse into \\neach other\\'s arms. \\n\\n\"You didn\\'t swallow any?\" I ask him. \\n\\nHe shakes his head. \"You?\" \\n\\n\"Guess I\\'d be dead by now if I did,\" I say. I can see his \\nlips moving in reply, but I can\\'t hear him over the \\nroar of the crowd in the Capitol that they\\'re playing \\nlive over the speakers. \\n\\nThe hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders \\ndrop, only there\\'s no way I\\'m letting go of Peeta. I \\nkeep one arm around him as I help him up, and we \\neach place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The \\nelectric current freezes us in place, and this time I\\'m \\nglad because I\\'m not really sure Peeta can hang on for \\nthe whole ride. And since my eyes were looking down, \\nI can see that while our muscles are immobile, \\nnothing is preventing the blood from draining out of \\nPeeta\\'s leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes \\nbehind us and the current stops, he slumps to the \\nfloor unconscious. \\n\\nMy fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so \\ntightly that when they take him away it tears leaving \\nme with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile \\nwhite, masked and gloved, already prepped to \\noperate, go into action. Peeta\\'s so pale and still on a \\nsilver table, tubes and wires springing out of him \\nevery which way, and for a moment I forget we\\'re out \\n331 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof the Games and I see the doctors as just one more \\nthreat, one more pack of mutts designed to kill him. \\nPetrified, I lunge for him, but I\\'m caught and thrust \\nback into another room, and a glass door seals \\nbetween us. I pound on the glass, screaming my head \\noff. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol \\nattendant who appears behind me and offers me a \\nbeverage. \\n\\nI slump down on the floor, my face against the door, \\nstaring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my \\nhand. Icy cold, filled with orange juice, a straw with a \\nfrilly white collar. How wrong it looks in my bloody, \\nfilthy hand with its dirt-caked nails and scars. My \\nmouth waters at the smell, but I place it carefully on \\nthe floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty. \\n\\nThrough the glass, I see the doctors working \\nfeverishly on Peeta, their brows creased in \\nconcentration. I see the flow of liquids, pumping \\nthrough the tubes, watch a wall of dials and lights \\nthat mean nothing to me. I\\'m not sure, but I think his \\nheart stops twice. \\n\\nIt\\'s like being home again, when they bring in the \\nhopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion, \\nor the woman in her third day of labor, or the \\nfamished child struggling against pneumonia and my \\nmother and Prim, they wear that same look on their \\nfaces. Now is the time to run away to the woods, to \\nhide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in \\nanother part of the Seam the hammers make the \\ncoffin. But I\\'m held here both by the hovercraft walls \\nand the same force that holds the loved ones of the \\ndying. How often I\\'ve seen them, ringed around our \\nkitchen table and I thought, Why don\\'t they leave? \\nWhy do they stay to watch? \\n\\nAnd now I know. It\\'s because you have no choice. \\n\\n332 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI startle when I catch someone staring at me from \\nonly a few inches away and then realize it\\'s my own \\nface reflecting back in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow \\ncheeks, my hair in a tangled mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. \\nNo wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from \\nme. \\n\\nThe next thing I know we\\'ve landed back on the roof \\nof the Training Center and they\\'re taking Peeta but \\nleaving me behind the door. I start hurling myself \\nagainst the glass, shrieking and I think I just catch a \\nglimpse of pink hair \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it must be Effie, it has to be \\nEffie coming to my rescue \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the needle jabs me \\nfrom behind. \\n\\nWhen I wake, I\\'m afraid to move at first. The entire \\nceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to \\nsee that I\\'m in a room containing just my bed. No \\ndoors, no windows are visible. The air smells of \\nsomething sharp and antiseptic. My right arm has \\nseveral tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I\\'m \\nnaked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my \\nskin. I tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. \\nNot only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are \\nfiled in perfect ovals, the scars from the burns are \\nless prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips, the \\npuckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just \\nrunning my fingers through my silken hair when I \\nfreeze. Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear. \\nNo, it wasn\\'t an illusion. I can hear again. \\n\\nI try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining \\nband around my waist keeps me from rising more \\nthan a few inches. The physical confinement makes \\nme panic and I\\'m trying to pull myself up and wriggle \\nmy hips through the band when a portion of the wall \\nslides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl \\ncarrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop \\ntrying to escape. I want to ask her a million \\n333 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nquestions, but I\\'m afraid any familiarity would cause \\nher harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. \\nShe sets the tray across my thighs and presses \\nsomething that raises me to a sitting position. While \\nshe adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it \\nout loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so \\nnothing will seem secretive. \"Did Peeta make it?\" She \\ngives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my \\nhand, I feel the pressure of friendship. \\n\\nI guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta \\nhas made it. Of course, he did. With all their \\nexpensive equipment here. Still, I hadn\\'t been sure \\nuntil now. \\n\\nAs the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after \\nher and I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear \\nbroth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of \\nwater. This is it? I think grouchily. Shouldn\\'t my \\nhomecoming dinner be a little more spectacular? But \\nI find it\\'s an effort to finish the spare meal before me. \\nMy stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a \\nchestnut, and I have to wonder how long I\\'ve been out \\nbecause I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable \\nbreakfast that last morning in the arena. There\\'s \\nusually a lag of a few days between the end of the \\ncompetition and the presentation of the victor so that \\nthey can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person \\nback together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia \\nwill be creating our wardrobes for the public \\nappearances. Haymitch and Effie will be arranging \\nthe banquet for our sponsors, reviewing the questions \\nfor our final interviews. Back home, District 12 is \\nprobably in chaos as they try and organize the \\nhomecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given that \\nthe last one was close to thirty years ago. \\n\\n\\n\\n334 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHome! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought \\nof Prim\\'s scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon I will \\nbe home! \\n\\nI want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, \\nto find out more about what\\'s been going on. And why \\nshouldn\\'t I? I feel fine. But as I start to work my way \\nout of the band, I feel a cold liquid seeping into my \\nvein from one of the tubes and almost immediately \\nlose consciousness. \\n\\nThis happens on and off for an indeterminate amount \\nof time. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist \\nthe impulse to try and escape the bed, being knocked \\nout again. I seem to be in a strange, continual \\ntwilight. Only a few things register. The redheaded \\nAvox girl has not returned since the feeding, my scars \\nare disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a \\nman\\'s voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in \\nthe rougher cadences of home. And I can\\'t help \\nhaving a vague, comforting feeling that someone is \\nlooking out for me. \\n\\nThen finally, the time arrives when I come to and \\nthere\\'s nothing plugged into my right arm. The \\nrestraint around my middle has been removed and I \\nam free to move about. I start to sit up but am \\narrested by the sight of my hands. The skin\\'s \\nperfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the \\nscars from the arena gone, but those accumulated \\nover years of hunting have vanished without a trace. \\nMy forehead feels like satin, and when I try to find the \\nburn on my calf, there\\'s nothing. \\n\\nI slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will \\nbear my weight and find them strong and steady. \\nLying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me \\nflinch. It\\'s what all of us tributes wore in the arena. I \\n\\n\\n\\n335 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nstare at it as if it had teeth until I remember that, of \\ncourse, this is what I will wear to greet my team. \\n\\nI\\'m dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in \\nfront of the wall where I know there\\'s a door even if I \\ncan\\'t see it when suddenly it slides open. I step into a \\nwide, deserted hall that appears to have no other \\ndoors on it. But it must. And behind one of them \\nmust be Peeta. Now that I\\'m conscious and moving, \\nI\\'m growing more and more anxious about him. He \\nmust be all right or the Avox girl wouldn\\'t have said \\nso. But I need to see him for myself. \\n\\n\"Peeta!\" I call out, since there\\'s no one to ask. I hear \\nmy name in response, but it\\'s not his voice. It\\'s a \\nvoice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness. \\nEffie. \\n\\nI turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at \\nthe end of the hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My \\nfeet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should \\nshow more restraint, more superiority, especially \\nwhen she knows this will be on tape, but I don\\'t care. \\nI run for them and surprise even myself when I \\nlaunch into Haymitch \\'s arms first. When he whispers \\nin my ear, \"Nice job, sweetheart,\" it doesn\\'t sound \\nsarcastic. Effie\\'s somewhat teary and keeps patting \\nmy hair and talking about how she told everyone we \\nwere pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesn\\'t say \\nanything. Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad \\nfeeling. \\n\\n\"Where\\'s Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, \\nisn\\'t he? I mean, he\\'s alive?\" I blurt out. \\n\\n\"He\\'s fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on \\nair at the ceremony,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\\n\\n336 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh. That\\'s all,\" I say. The awful moment of thinking \\nPeeta\\'s dead again passes. \"I guess I\\'d want to see \\nthat myself.\" \\n\\n\"Go on with Cinna. He has to get you ready,\" says \\nHaymitch. \\n\\nIt\\'s a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his \\nprotective arm around my shoulders as he guides me \\naway from the cameras, down a few passages and to \\nan elevator that leads to the lobby of the Training \\nCenter. The hospital then is far underground, even \\nbeneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying \\nknots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby \\nare darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. \\nNo one else is there to see us cross to the tribute \\nelevator. Our footsteps echo in the emptiness. And \\nwhen we ride up to the twelfth floor, the faces of all \\nthe tributes who will never return flash across my \\nmind and there\\'s a heavy, tight place in my chest. \\n\\nWhen the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and \\nOctavia engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically \\nI can\\'t make out their words. The sentiment is clear \\nthough. They are truly thrilled to see me and I\\'m \\nhappy to see them, too, although not like I was to see \\nCinna. It\\'s more in the way one might be glad to see \\nan affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly \\ndifficult day. \\n\\nThey sweep me into the dining room and I get a real \\nmeal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 roast beef and peas and soft rolls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although \\nmy portions are still being strictly controlled. Because \\nwhen I ask for seconds, I\\'m refused. \\n\\n\"No, no, no. They don\\'t want it all coming back up on \\nthe stage,\" says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an \\nextra roll under the table to let me know she\\'s on my \\nside. \\n\\n\\n\\n337 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nWe go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a \\nwhile as the prep team gets me ready. \\n\\n\"Oh, they did a full body polish on you,\" says Flavius \\nenviously. \"Not a flaw left on your skin.\" \\n\\nBut when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I \\ncan see is how skinny I am. I mean, I\\'m sure I was \\nworse when I came out of the arena, but I can easily \\ncount my ribs. \\n\\nThey take care of the shower settings for me, and they \\ngo to work on my hair, nails, and makeup when I\\'m \\ndone. They chatter so continuously that I barely have \\nto reply, which is good, since I don\\'t feel very \\ntalkative. It\\'s funny, because even though they\\'re \\nrattling on about the Games, it\\'s all about where they \\nwere or what they were doing or how they felt when a \\nspecific event occurred. \"I was still in bed!\" \"I had just \\nhad my eyebrows dyed!\" \"I swear I nearly fainted!\" \\nEverything is about them, not the dying boys and \\ngirls in the arena. \\n\\nWe don\\'t wallow around in the Games this way in \\nDistrict 12. We grit our teeth and watch because we \\nmust and try to get back to business as soon as \\npossible when they\\'re over. To keep from hating the \\nprep team, I effectively tune out most of what they\\'re \\nsaying. \\n\\nCinna comes in with what appears to be an \\nunassuming yellow dress across his arms. \\n\\n\"Have you given up the whole \\'girl on fire\\' thing?\" I \\nask. \\n\\n\"You tell me,\" he says, and slips it over my head. I \\nimmediately notice the padding over my breasts, \\n\\n\\n\\n338 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nadding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. \\nMy hands go to my chest and I frown. \\n\\n\"I know,\" says Cinna before I can object. \"But the \\nGamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. \\nHaymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This \\nwas the compromise.\" He stops me before I can look \\nat my reflection. \"Wait, don\\'t forget the shoes. \"Venia \\nhelps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I turn \\nto the mirror. \\n\\nI am still the \"girl on fire.\" The sheer fabric softly \\nglows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a \\nripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot \\ncostume seems garish, the interview dress too \\ncontrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing \\ncandlelight. \\n\\n\"What do you think?\" asks Cinna. \\n\\n\"I think it\\'s the best yet,\" I say. When I manage to pull \\nmy eyes away from the flickering fabric, I\\'m in for \\nsomething of a shock. My hair\\'s loose, held back by a \\nsimple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the \\nsharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. \\nThe sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my \\nwaist, largely eliminating any help the padding would \\nhave given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. \\nWithout heels, you can see my true stature. I look, \\nvery simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the \\nmost. Innocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that \\nCinna has pulled this off when you remember I\\'ve just \\nwon the Games. \\n\\nThis is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs \\nis arbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his \\nmotivation. \\n\\n\\n\\n339 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it\\'d be something more ... sophisticated- \\nlooking,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I thought Peeta would like this better,\" he answers \\ncarefully. \\n\\nPeeta? No, it\\'s not about Peeta. It\\'s about the Capitol \\nand the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do \\nnot yet understand Cinna\\'s design, it\\'s a reminder the \\nGames are not quite finished. And beneath his benign \\nreply, I sense a warning. Of something he can\\'t even \\nmention in front of his own team. \\n\\nWe take the elevator to the level where we trained. It\\'s \\ncustomary for the victor and his or her support team \\nto rise from beneath the stage. First the prep team, \\nfollowed by the escort, the stylist, the mentor, and \\nfinally the victor. Only this year, with two victors who \\nshare both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing \\nhas had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly lit \\narea under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has \\nbeen installed to transport me upward. You can still \\nsee small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna \\nand the prep team peel off to change into their own \\ncostumes and take their positions, leaving me alone. \\nIn the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten yards \\naway and assume Peeta\\'s behind it. \\n\\nThe rumbling of the crowd is loud, so I don\\'t notice \\nHaymitch until he touches my shoulder. I spring \\naway, startled, still half in the arena, I guess. \\n\\n\"Easy, just me. Let\\'s have a look at you,\" Haymitch \\nsays. I hold out my arms and turn once. \"Good \\nenough.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s not much of a compliment. \"But what?\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n340 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch\\'s eyes shift around my musty holding \\nspace, and he seems to make a decision. \"But \\nnothing. How about a hug for luck?\" \\n\\nOkay, that\\'s an odd request from Haymitch but, after \\nall, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. \\nOnly, when I put my arms around his neck, I find \\nmyself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, \\nvery fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing \\nhis lips. \\n\\n\"Listen up. You\\'re in trouble. Word is the Capitol\\'s \\nfurious about you showing them up in the arena. The \\none thing they can\\'t stand is being laughed at and \\nthey\\'re the joke of Panem,\"says Haymitch. \\n\\nI feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as \\nthough Haymitch is saying something completely \\ndelightful because nothing is covering my mouth. \"So, \\nwhat?\" \\n\\n\"Your only defense can be you were so madly in love \\nyou weren\\'t responsible for your actions.\" Haymitch \\npulls back and adjusts my hairband. \"Got it, \\nsweetheart?\" He could be talking about anything now. \\n\\n\"Got it,\" I say. \"Did you tell Peeta this?\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t have to,\" says Haymitch. \"He\\'s already there.\" \\n\\n\"But you think I\\'m not?\" I say, taking the opportunity \\nto straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have \\nwrestled him into. \\n\\n\"Since when does it matter what I think?\" says \\nHaymitch. \"Better take our places.\" He leads me to the \\nmetal circle. \"This is your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it.\" \\nHe kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the \\ngloom. \\n\\n\\n\\n341 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nI tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to \\ncover the knocking in my knees. Then I realize it\\'s \\npointless. My whole body\\'s shaking like a leaf. \\nHopefully, it will be put down to excitement. After all, \\nit\\'s my night. \\n\\nThe damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens \\nto choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my \\nskin and I can\\'t rid myself of the feeling that the \\nboards above my head are about to collapse, to bury \\nme alive under the rubble. When I left the arena, \\nwhen the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe. \\nFrom then on. For the rest of my life. But if what \\nHaymitch says is true, and he\\'s got no reason to lie, \\nI\\'ve never been in such a dangerous place in my life. \\n\\nIt\\'s so much worse than being hunted in the arena. \\nThere, I could only die. End of story. But out here \\nPrim, my mother, Gale, the people of District 12, \\neveryone I care about back home could be punished if \\nI can\\'t pull off the girl-driven-crazy-by-love scenario \\nHaymitch has suggested. \\n\\nSo I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, \\nwhen I poured out those berries, I was only thinking \\nof outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions \\nwould reflect on the Capitol. But the Hunger Games \\nare their weapon and you are not supposed to be able \\nto defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if they\\'ve \\nbeen in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated \\nthe whole event, right down to the double suicide. But \\nthat will only work if I play along with them. \\n\\nAnd Peeta ... Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. \\nBut what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had \\ntold Peeta the situation? That he had to pretend to be \\ndesperately in love? \\n\\n\"Don\\'t have to. He\\'s already there.\" \\n\\n342 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nAlready thinking ahead of me in the Games again and \\nwell aware of the danger we\\'re in? Or ... already \\ndesperately in love? I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t even \\nbegun to separate out my feelings about Peeta. It\\'s too \\ncomplicated. What I did as part of the Games. As \\nopposed to what I did out of anger at the Capitol. Or \\nbecause of how it would be viewed back in District 12. \\nOr simply because it was the only decent thing to do. \\nOr what I did because I cared about him. \\n\\n\\n\\nThese are questions to be unraveled back home, in \\nthe peace and quiet of the woods, when no one is \\nwatching. Not here with every eye upon me. But I \\nwon\\'t have that luxury for who knows how long. And \\nright now, the most dangerous part of the Hunger \\nGames is about to begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n343 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear \\nCaesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he \\nknow how crucial it is to get every word right from \\nnow on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd \\nbreaks into applause as the prep teams are \\npresented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia \\nbouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing \\nbows. It\\'s a safe bet they\\'re clueless. Then Effie\\'s \\nintroduced. How long she\\'s waited for this moment. I \\nhope she\\'s able to enjoy it because as misguided as \\nEffie can be, she has a very keen instinct about \\ncertain things and must at least suspect we\\'re in \\ntrouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of \\ncourse, they\\'ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I \\nnow understand Cinna \\'s choice of dress for me for \\ntonight. Ill need to look as girlish and innocent as \\npossible. Haymitch\\'s appearance brings a round of \\nstomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, he\\'s \\naccomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two \\ntributes alive. What if he hadn\\'t warned me in time? \\nWould I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment \\nwith the berries in the Capitol\\'s face? No, I don\\'t think \\nso. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing \\nthan I need to be now. Right now. Because I can feel \\nthe plate lifting me up to the stage. \\n\\nBlinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal \\nunder my feet. Then there\\'s Peeta just a few yards \\naway. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, I \\ncan hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same \\nwhether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it, I \\ntake about three steps and fling myself into his arms. \\nHe staggers back, almost losing his balance, and \\nthat\\'s when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his \\nhand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we \\n344 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\njust cling to each other while the audience goes \\ninsane. He\\'s kissing me and all the time I\\'m thinking, \\nDo you know? Do you know how much danger we\\'re \\nin? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar \\nFlickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the \\nshow, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even \\nglancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether \\nhe knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd \\nexactly right. \\n\\nFinally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good- \\nnatured shove toward the victor\\'s chair. Usually, this \\nis a single, ornate chair from which the winning \\ntribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, \\nbut since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have \\nprovided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my \\nmother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close \\nto Peeta that I\\'m practically on his lap, but one look \\nfrom Haymitch tells me it isn\\'t enough. Kicking off my \\nsandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head \\nagainst Peeta\\'s shoulder. His arm goes around me \\nautomatically, and I feel like I\\'m back in the cave, \\ncurled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt \\nis made of the same yellow material as my dress, but \\nPortia\\'s put him in long black pants. No sandals, \\neither, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps \\nsolidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given \\nme a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy \\ndress. But I guess that was the point. \\n\\nCaesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then \\nit\\'s time for the show. This will last exactly three \\nhours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the \\nlights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I \\nrealize I\\'m unprepared for this. I do not want to watch \\nmy twenty- two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of \\nthem die the first time. My heart starts pounding and \\nI have a strong impulse to run. How have the other \\nvictors faced this alone? During the highlights, they \\n345 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nperiodically show the winner\\'s reaction up on a box in \\nthe corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years \\n. . . some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the \\nair, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All \\nI know is that the only thing keeping me on this love \\nseat is Peeta \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his arm around my shoulder, his \\nother hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the \\nprevious victors didn\\'t have the Capitol looking for a \\nway to destroy them. \\n\\nCondensing several weeks into three hours is quite a \\nfeat, especially when you consider how many cameras \\nwere going at once. Whoever puts together the \\nhighlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. \\nThis year, for the first time, they tell a love story. I \\nknow Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount \\nof time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I\\'m \\nglad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in- \\nlove thing that\\'s my defense for defying the Capitol, \\nplus it means we won\\'t have as much time to linger \\nover the deaths. \\n\\nThe first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena \\nevents, the reaping, the chariot ride through the \\nCapitol, our training scores, and our interviews. \\nThere\\'s this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under \\nit that makes it twice as awful because, of course, \\nalmost everyone on-screen is dead. \\n\\nOnce we\\'re in the arena, there\\'s detailed coverage of \\nthe bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically \\nalternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of \\nus. Mostly Peeta really, there\\'s no question he\\'s \\ncarrying this romance thing on his shoulders. Now I \\nsee what the audience saw, how he misled the \\nCareers about me, stayed awake the entire night \\nunder the tracker j acker tree, fought Cato to let me \\nescape and even while he lay in that mud bank, \\nwhispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in \\n346 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\ncomparison \\xe2\\x80\\x94 dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and \\nblowing up supplies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 until I go hunting for Rue. \\nThey play her death in full, the spearing, my failed \\nrescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from \\nDistrict 1 \\'s throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my \\narms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the \\nsong. Something inside me shuts down and I\\'m too \\nnumb to feel anything. It\\'s like watching complete \\nstrangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice \\nthey omit the part where I covered her in flowers. \\n\\nRight. Because even that smacks of rebellion. \\n\\nThings pick up for me once they\\'ve announced two \\ntributes from the same district can live and I shout \\nout Peeta\\'s name and then clap my hands over my \\nmouth. If I\\'ve seemed indifferent to him earlier, I \\nmake up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back \\nto health, going to the feast for the medicine, and \\nbeing very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see \\nthe mutts and Cato\\'s death are as gruesome as ever, \\nbut again, I feel it happens to people I have never met. \\n\\nAnd then comes the moment with the berries. I can \\nhear the audience hushing one another, not wanting \\nto miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the \\nfilmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with \\nthe announcement of our victory, but with me \\npounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, \\nscreaming Peeta\\'s name as they try to revive him. \\n\\nIn terms of survival, it\\'s my best moment all night. \\n\\nThe anthem\\'s playing yet again and we rise as \\nPresident Snow himself takes the stage followed by a \\nlittle girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. \\nThere\\'s just one crown, though, and you can hear the \\ncrowd\\'s confusion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose head will he place it on? \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 until President Snow gives it a twist and it \\n347 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nseparates into two halves. He places the first around \\nPeeta\\'s brow with a smile. He\\'s still smiling when he \\nsettles the second on my head, but his eyes, just \\ninches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snake\\'s. \\n\\nThat\\'s when I know that even though both of us \\nwould have eaten the berries, I am to blame for \\nhaving the idea. I\\'m the instigator. I\\'m the one to be \\npunished. \\n\\nMuch bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about \\nto fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally \\nbids the audience good night, reminding them to tune \\nin tomorrow for the final interviews. As if they have a \\nchoice. \\n\\nPeeta and I are whisked to the president\\'s mansion \\nfor the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time \\nto eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous \\nsponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try \\nto get their picture with us. Face after beaming face \\nflashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the \\nevening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of \\nHaymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, \\nwhich is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking \\npeople and smiling as my picture is taken. The one \\nthing I never do is let go of Peeta\\'s hand. \\n\\nThe sun is just peeking over the horizon when we \\nstraggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training \\nCenter. I think now 111 finally get a word alone with \\nPeeta, but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get \\nsomething fitted for the interview and personally \\nescorts me to my door. \\n\\n\"Why can\\'t I talk to him?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Plenty of time for talk when we get home,\" says \\n\\nHaymitch. \"Go to bed, you\\'re on air at two.\" \\n\\n348 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nDespite Haymitch\\'s running interference, I\\'m \\ndetermined to see Peeta privately. After I toss and \\nturn for a few hours, I slip into the hall. My first \\nthought is to check the roof, but it\\'s empty. Even the \\ncity streets far below are deserted after the \\ncelebration last night. I go back to bed for a while and \\nthen decide to go directly to his room, but when I try \\nto turn the knob, I find my own bedroom door has \\nbeen locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch \\ninitially, but then there\\'s a more insidious fear that \\nthe Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. I\\'ve \\nbeen unable to escape since the Hunger Games \\nbegan, but this feels different, much more personal. \\nThis feels like I\\'ve been imprisoned for a crime and \\nI\\'m awaiting sentencing. I quickly get back in bed and \\npretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me \\nto the start of another \"big, big, big day!\" \\n\\nI have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain \\nand stew before the prep team descends. All I have to \\nsay is, \"The crowd loved you!\" and it\\'s unnecessary to \\nspeak for the next couple of hours. When Cinna \\ncomes in, he shoos them out and dresses me in a \\nwhite, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he \\npersonally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate \\na soft, rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but I\\'m \\nafraid to ask him anything of real importance because \\nafter the incident with the door, I can\\'t shake the \\nfeeling that I\\'m being watched constantly. \\n\\nThe interview takes place right down the hall in the \\nsitting room. A space has been cleared and the love \\nseat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of \\nred and pink roses. There are only a handful of \\ncameras to record the event. No live audience at least. \\n\\nCaesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. \\ncome in. \"Congratulations, Katniss. How are you \\nfaring?\" \\n\\n349 | P a g e The Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fine. Nervous about the interview,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be. We\\'re going to have a fabulous time,\" he \\nsays, giving my cheek a reassuring pat. \\n\\n\"I\\'m not good at talking about myself,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Nothing you say will be wrong,\" he says. \\n\\nAnd I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But \\nactually, President Snow may be arranging some sort \\nof\\'accident\" for me as we speak. \\n\\nThen Peeta\\'s there looking handsome in red and \\nwhite, pulling me off to the side. \"I hardly get to see \\nyou. Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart.\" \\n\\nHaymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but \\nthere are too many ears listening, so I just say, \"Yes, \\nhe\\'s gotten very responsible lately.\" \\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s just this and we go home. Then he can\\'t \\nwatch us all the time,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI feel a sort of shiver run through me and there\\'s no \\ntime to analyze why, because they\\'re ready for us. We \\nsit somewhat formally on the love seat, but Caesar \\nsays, \"Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you \\nwant. It looked very sweet.\" So I tuck my feet up and \\nPeeta pulls me in close to him. \\n\\nSomeone counts backward and just like that, we\\'re \\nbeing broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar \\nFlickerman is wonderful, teasing, joking, getting \\nchoked up when the occasion presents itself. He and \\nPeeta already have the rapport they established that \\nnight of the first interview, that easy banter, so I just \\nsmile a lot and try to speak as little as possible. I \\n\\n\\n\\n350 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nmean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I \\nredirect the conversation back to Peeta. \\n\\nEventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions \\nthat insist on fuller answers. \"Well, Peeta, we know, \\nfrom our days in the cave, that it was love at first \\nsight for you from what, age five?\" Caesar says. \\n\\n\"From the moment I laid eyes on her,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"But, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real \\nexcitement for the audience was watching you fall for \\nhim. When did you realize you were in love with him?\" \\nasks Caesar. \\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s a hard one ...\" I give a faint, breathy laugh \\nand look down at my hands. Help. \\n\\n\"Well, I know when it hit me. The night when you \\nshouted out his name from that tree,\" says Caesar. \\n\\nThank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. \\n\"Yes, I guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I \\njust tried not to think about what my feelings might \\nbe, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only \\nmade things worse if I actually cared about him. But \\nthen, in the tree, everything changed,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Why do you think that was?\" urges Caesar. \\n\\n\"Maybe . . . because for the first time . . . there was a \\nchance I could keep him,\" I say. \\n\\nBehind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of \\nhuff with relief and I know I\\'ve said the right thing. \\nCaesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a \\nmoment because he\\'s so moved. I can feel Peeta press \\nhis forehead into my temple and he asks, \"So now \\n\\n\\n\\n351 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nthat you\\'ve got me, what are you going to do with \\nme?\" \\n\\nI turn in to him. \"Put you somewhere you can\\'t get \\nhurt.\" And when he kisses me, people in the room \\nactually sigh. \\n\\nFor Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all \\nthe ways we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to \\nstings, to wounds. But it\\'s not until we get around to \\nthe mutts that I forget I\\'m on camera. When Caesar \\nasks Peeta how his \"new leg\" is working out. \\n\\n\"New leg?\" I say, and I can\\'t help reaching out and \\npulling up the bottom of Peeta\\'s pants. \"Oh, no,\" I \\nwhisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that \\nhas replaced his flesh. \\n\\n\"No one told you?\" asks Caesar gently. I shake my \\nhead. \\n\\n\"I haven\\'t had the chance,\" says Peeta with a slight \\nshrug. \\n\\n\"It\\'s my fault,\" I say. \"Because I used that tourniquet.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s your fault I\\'m alive,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He\\'s right,\" says Caesar. \"He\\'d have bled to death for \\nsure without it.\" \\n\\nI guess this is true, but I can\\'t help feeling upset \\nabout it to the extent that I\\'m afraid I might cry and \\nthen I remember everyone in the country is watching \\nme so I just bury my face in Peeta\\'s shirt. It takes \\nthem a couple of minutes to coax me back out \\nbecause it\\'s better in the shirt, where no one can see \\nme, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off \\n\\n\\n\\n352 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nquestioning me so I can recover. In fact, he pretty \\nmuch leaves me alone until the berries come up. \\n\\n\"Katniss, I know you\\'ve had a shock, but I\\'ve got to \\nask. The moment when you pulled out those berries. \\nWhat was going on in your mind ... hm?\" he says. \\n\\nI take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect \\nmy thoughts. This is the crucial moment where I \\neither challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the \\nidea of losing Peeta that I can\\'t be held responsible for \\nmy actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic \\nspeech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible \\nsentence. \"I don\\'t know, I just ... couldn\\'t bear the \\nthought of ... being without him.\" \\n\\n\"Peeta? Anything to add?\" asks Caesar. \\n\\n\"No. I think that goes for both of us,\" he says. \\n\\nCaesar signs off and it\\'s over. Everyone\\'s laughing \\nand crying and hugging, but I\\'m still not sure until I \\nreach Haymitch.\"Okay?\" I whisper. \\n\\n\"Perfect,\" he answers. \\n\\nI go back to my room to collect a few things and find \\nthere\\'s nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge \\ngave me. Someone returned it to my room after the \\nGames. They drive us through the streets in a car \\nwith blackened windows, and the train\\'s waiting for \\nus. We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and \\nPortia, although we\\'ll see them in a few months, when \\nwe tour the districts for a round of victory \\nceremonies. It\\'s the Capitol\\'s way of reminding people \\nthat the Hunger Games never really go away. Well be \\ngiven a lot of useless plaques, and everyone will have \\nto pretend they love us. \\n\\n\\n\\n353 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nThe train begins moving and we\\'re plunged into night \\nuntil we clear the tunnel and I take my first free \\nbreath since the reaping. Effie is accompanying us \\nback and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an \\nenormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the \\ntelevision to watch a replay of the interview. With the \\nCapitol growing farther away every second, I begin to \\nthink of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I \\nexcuse myself to change out of my dress and into a \\nplain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash \\nthe makeup from my face and put my hair in its \\nbraid, I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss \\nEverdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the \\nwoods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try \\nto remember who I am and who I am not. By the time \\nI join the others, the pressure of Peeta\\'s arm around \\nmy shoulders feels alien. \\n\\nWhen the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we\\'re \\nallowed to go outside for some fresh air. There\\'s no \\nlonger any need to guard us. Peeta and I walk down \\nalong the track, hand in hand, and I can\\'t find \\nanything to say now that we\\'re alone. He stops to \\ngather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he \\npresents them, I work hard to look pleased. Because \\nhe can\\'t know that the pink-and-white flowers are the \\ntops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours \\nI\\'ve spent gathering them with Gale. \\n\\nGale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours \\nmakes my stomach churn. But why? I can\\'t quite \\nframe it in my mind. I only know that I feel like I\\'ve \\nbeen lying to someone who trusts me. Or more \\naccurately, to two people. I\\'ve been getting away with \\nit up to this point because of the Games. But there \\nwill be no Games to hide behind back home. \\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\\n\\n354 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" I answer. We continue walking, past the \\nend of the train, out where even I\\'m fairly sure there \\nare no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along \\nthe track. Still no words come. \\n\\nHaymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my \\nback. Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps \\nhis voice down. \"Great job, you two. Just keep it up in \\nthe district until the cameras are gone. We should be \\nokay.\" I watch him head back to the train, avoiding \\nPeeta\\'s eyes. \\n\\n\"What\\'s he mean?\" Peeta asks me. \\n\\n\"It\\'s the Capitol. They didn\\'t like our stunt with the \\nberries,\" I blurt out. \\n\\n\"What? What are you talking about?\" he says. \\n\\n\"It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been \\ncoaching me through the last few days. So I didn\\'t \\nmake it worse, \"I say. \\n\\n\"Coaching you? But not me,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He knew you were smart enough to get it right,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know there was anything to get right,\" says \\nPeeta. \"So, what you\\'re saying is, these last few days \\nand then I guess . . . back in the arena . . . that was just \\nsome strategy you two worked out.\" \\n\\n\"No. I mean, I couldn\\'t even talk to him in the arena, \\ncould I?\" I stammer. \\n\\n\"But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn\\'t \\nyou?\"says Peeta. I bite my lip. \"Katniss?\" He drops my \\nhand and I take a step, as if to catch my balance. \\n\\n\\n\\n355 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was all for the Games,\" Peeta says. \"How you \\nacted.\" \\n\\n\"Not all of it,\" I say, tightly holding onto my flowers. \\n\\n\"Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real \\nquestion is what\\'s going to be left when we get home?\" \\nhe says. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the \\nmore confused I get,\" I say. He waits, for further \\nexplanation, but none\\'s forthcoming. \\n\\n\"Well, let me know when you work it out,\" he says, \\nand the pain in his voice is palpable. \\n\\nI know my ears are healed because, even with the \\nrumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes \\nback to the train. By the time I\\'ve climbed aboard, \\nPeeta has disappeared into his room for the night. I \\ndon\\'t see him the next morning, either. In fact, the \\nnext time he turns up, we\\'re pulling into District 12. \\nHe gives me a nod, his face expressionless. \\n\\nI want to tell him that he\\'s not being fair. That we \\nwere strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to \\nkeep us both alive in the arena. That I can\\'t explain \\nhow things are with Gale because I don\\'t know \\nmyself. That it\\'s no good loving me because I\\'m never \\ngoing to get married anyway and he\\'d just end up \\nhating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have \\nfeelings for him, it doesn\\'t matter because I\\'ll never be \\nable to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to \\nchildren. And how can he? How can he after what \\nwe\\'ve just been through? \\n\\nI also want to tell him how much I already miss him. \\nBut that wouldn\\'t be fair on my part. \\n\\n\\n\\n356 | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - Suzanne Collins \\n\\n\\n\\nSo we just stand there silently, watching our grimy \\nlittle station rise up around us. Through the window, \\nI can see the platform\\'s thick with cameras. Everyone \\nwill be eagerly watching our homecoming. \\n\\nOut of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his \\nhand. I look at him, unsure. \"One more time? For the \\naudience?\" he says. His voice isn\\'t angry. It\\'s hollow, \\nwhich is worse. Already the boy with the bread is \\nslipping away from me. \\n\\nI take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the \\ncameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally \\nhave to let go. \\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'\\nTHE\\nHUNGER \\nGAMES \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPARTI \\n\"THE TRIBUTES\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My \\nfingers stretch out, seeking Prim\\'s warmth but finding \\nonly the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She \\nmust have had bad dreams and climbed in with our \\nmother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the \\nreaping. \\n\\nI prop myself up on one elbow. There\\'s enough light in \\nthe bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled \\nup on her side, cocooned in my mother\\'s body, their \\ncheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks \\nyounger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim\\'s \\nface is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the \\nprimrose for which she was named. My mother was \\nvery beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me. \\n\\nSitting at Prim\\'s knees, guarding her, is the world\\'s \\nugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, \\neyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him \\nButtercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat \\nmatched the bright flower. I le hates me. Or at least \\ndistrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he \\nstill remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket \\nwhen Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly \\nswollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last \\nthing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim \\nbegged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It \\nturned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and \\nhe\\'s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. \\nSometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the \\nentrails. He has stopped hissing at me. \\n\\nEntrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever \\ncome to love. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting \\nboots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I \\npull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up \\ninto a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, \\nunder a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats \\nand cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese \\nwrapped in basil leaves. Prim\\'s gift to me on reaping \\nday. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip \\noutside. \\n\\nOur part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is \\nusually crawling with coal miners heading out to the \\nmorning shift at this hour. Men and women with \\nhunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who \\nhave long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust \\nout of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken \\nfaces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. \\nShutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The \\nreaping isn\\'t until two. May as well sleep in. If you \\ncan. \\n\\nOur house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only \\nhave to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field \\ncalled the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the \\nwoods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high \\nchain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In \\ntheory, it\\'s supposed to be electrified twenty-four \\nhours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live \\nin the woods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, \\nbears \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that used to threaten our streets. But since \\nwe\\'re lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in \\nthe evenings, it\\'s usually safe to touch. Even so, I \\nalways take a moment to listen carefully for the hum \\nthat means the fence is live. Right now, it\\'s silent as a \\nstone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out \\non my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that\\'s \\nbeen loose for years. There are several other weak \\nspots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I \\nalmost always enter the woods here. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as I\\'m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and \\nsheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, \\nthe fence has been successful at keeping the flesh- \\neaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam \\nfreely, and there are added concerns like venomous \\nsnakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. \\nBut there\\'s also food if you know how to find it. My \\nfather knew and he taught me some before he was \\nblown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing \\neven to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still \\nwake up screaming for him to run. \\n\\nEven though trespassing in the woods is illegal and \\npoaching carries the severest of penalties, more \\npeople would risk it if they had weapons. But most \\nare not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. \\nMy bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a \\nfew others that I keep well hidden in the woods, \\ncarefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father \\ncould have made good money selling them, but if the \\nofficials found out he would have been publicly \\nexecuted for inciting a rebellion. Most of the \\nPeacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who \\nhunt because they\\'re as hungry for fresh meat as \\nanybody is. In fact, they\\'re among our best \\ncustomers. But the idea that someone might be \\narming the Seam would never have been allowed. \\n\\nIn the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to \\nharvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. \\nAlways close enough to run back to the safety of \\nDistrict 12 if trouble arises. \"District Twelve. Where \\nyou can starve to death in safety,\" I mutter. Then I \\nglance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in \\nthe middle of nowhere, you worry someone might \\noverhear you. \\n\\nWhen I was younger, I scared my mother to death, \\nthe things I would blurt out about District 12, about \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthe people who rule our country, Panem, from the far- \\noff city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood \\nthis would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned \\nto hold my tongue and to turn my features into an \\nindifferent mask so that no one could ever read my \\nthoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only \\npolite small talk in the public market. Discuss little \\nmore than trades in the Hob, which is the black \\nmarket where I make most of my money. Even at \\nhome, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing \\ntricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or \\nthe Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my \\nwords and then where would we be? \\n\\nIn the woods waits the only person with whom I can \\nbe myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face \\nrelaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to \\nour place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket \\nof berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The \\nsight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale \\nsays I never smile except in the woods. \\n\\n\"Hey, Catnip,\" says Gale. My real name is Katniss, \\nbut when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. \\nSo he thought I\\'d said Catnip. Then when this crazy \\nlynx started following me around the woods looking \\nfor handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I \\nfinally had to kill the lynx because he scared off \\ngame. I almost regretted it because he wasn\\'t bad \\ncompany. But I got a decent price for his pelt. \\n\\n\"Look what I shot,\" Gale holds up a loaf of bread with \\nan arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It\\'s real bakery \\nbread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our \\ngrain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the \\narrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, \\ninhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood \\nwith saliva. Fine bread like this is for special \\noccasions. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mm, still warm,\" I say. He must have been at the \\nbakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. \"What did \\nit cost you?\" \\n\\n\"Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling \\nsentimental this morning,\" says Gale. \"Even wished \\nme luck.\" \\n\\n\"Well, we all feel a little closer today, don\\'t we?\" I say, \\nnot even bothering to roll my eyes. \"Prim left us a \\ncheese.\" I pull it out. \\n\\nHis expression brightens at the treat. \"Thank you, \\nPrim. We\\'ll have a real feast.\" Suddenly he falls into a \\nCapitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the \\nmaniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to \\nread out the names at the leaping. \"I almost forgot! \\nHappy Hunger Games!\" He plucks a few blackberries \\nfrom the bushes around us. \"And may the odds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\nHe tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. \\n\\nI catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin \\nwith my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my \\ntongue. \" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 be ever in your favor!\" I finish with equal \\nverve. We have to joke about it because the \\nalternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, \\nthe Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything \\nsounds funny in it. \\n\\nI watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the \\nbread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, \\nolive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But we\\'re \\nnot related, at least not closely. Most of the families \\nwho work the mines resemble one another this way. \\n\\nThat\\'s why my mother and Prim, with their light hair \\nand blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My \\nmother\\'s parents were part of the small merchant \\nclass that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\noccasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary \\nshop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no \\none can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. \\nMy father got to know my mother because on his \\nhunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs \\nand sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. \\nShe must have really loved him to leave her home for \\nthe Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is \\nthe woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while \\nher children turned to skin and bones. I try to forgive \\nher for my father\\'s sake. But to be honest, I\\'m not the \\nforgiving type. \\n\\nGale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat \\ncheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I \\nstrip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a \\nnook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible \\nbut have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming \\nwith summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish \\niridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a \\nblue sky and soft breeze. The food\\'s wonderful, with \\nthe cheese seeping into the warm bread and the \\nberries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be \\nperfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off \\nmeant was roaming the mountains with Gale, \\nhunting for tonight\\'s supper. But instead we have to \\nbe standing in the square at two o\\'clock waiting for \\nthe names to be called out. \\n\\n\"We could do it, you know,\" Gale says quietly. \\n\\n\"What?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You \\nand I, we could make it,\" says Gale. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how to respond. The idea is so \\npreposterous. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"If we didn\\'t have so many kids,\" he adds quickly. \\n\\nThey\\'re not our kids, of course. But they might as well \\nbe. Gale\\'s two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And \\nyou may as well throw in our mothers, too, because \\nhow would they live without us? Who would fill those \\nmouths that are always asking for more? With both of \\nus hunting daily, there are still nights when game has \\nto be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still \\nnights when we go to bed with our stomachs \\ngrowling. \\n\\n\"I never want to have kids,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I might. If I didn\\'t live here,\" says Gale. \\n\\n\"But you do,\" I say, irritated. \\n\\n\"Forget it,\" he snaps back. \\n\\nThe conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I \\nleave Prim, who is the only person in the world I\\'m \\ncertain I love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We \\ncan\\'t leave, so why bother talking about it? And even \\nif we did . . . even if we did . . . where did this stuff \\nabout having kids come from? There\\'s never been \\nanything romantic between Gale and me. When we \\nmet, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he \\nwas only two years older, he already looked like a \\nman. It took a long time for us to even become \\nfriends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin \\nhelping each other out. \\n\\nBesides, if he wants kids, Gale won\\'t have any trouble \\nfinding a wife. He\\'s good-looking, he\\'s strong enough \\nto handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. \\nYou can tell by the way the girls whisper about him \\nwhen he walks by in school that they want him. It \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nmakes me jealous but not for the reason people would \\nthink. Good hunting partners are hard to find. \\n\\n\"What do you want to do?\" I ask. We can hunt, fish, \\nor gather. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and \\ngather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\nTonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to \\ncelebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that \\ntheir children have been spared for another year. But \\nat least two families will pull their shutters, lock their \\ndoors, and try to figure out how they will survive the \\npainful weeks to come. \\n\\nWe make out well. The predators ignore us on a day \\nwhen easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, \\nwe have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, \\na gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a few years \\nago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around \\nit to keep out the animals. \\n\\nOn the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black \\nmarket that operates in an abandoned warehouse \\nthat once held coal. When they came up with a more \\nefficient system that transported the coal directly \\nfrom the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took \\nover the space. Most businesses are closed by this \\ntime on reaping day, but the black market\\'s still fairly \\nbusy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, \\nthe other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old \\nwoman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large \\nkettle, takes half the greens off our hands in \\nexchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might \\ndo a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to \\nkeep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She\\'s the only \\none who can consistently be counted on to buy wild \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ndog. We don\\'t hunt them on purpose, but if you\\'re \\nattacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is \\nmeat. \"Once it\\'s in the soup, 111 call it beef,\" Greasy \\nSae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn \\nup their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the \\nPeacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a \\nlittle choosier. \\n\\nWhen we finish our business at the market, we go to \\nthe back door of the mayor\\'s house to sell half the \\nstrawberries, knowing he has a particular fondness \\nfor them and can afford our price. The mayor\\'s \\ndaughter, Madge, opens the door. She\\'s in my year at \\nschool. Being the mayor\\'s daughter, you\\'d expect her \\nto be a snob, but she\\'s all right. She just keeps to \\nherself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a \\ngroup of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at \\nschool. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at \\nassemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely \\ntalk, which suits us both just fine. \\n\\nToday her drab school outfit has been replaced by an \\nexpensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up \\nwith a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes. \\n\\n\"Pretty dress,\" says Gale. \\n\\nMadge shoots him a look, trying to see if it\\'s a \\ngenuine compliment or if he\\'s just being ironic. Itisa \\npretty dress, but she would never be wearing it \\nordinarily. She presses her lips together and then \\nsmiles. \"Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want \\nto look nice, don\\'t I?\" \\n\\nNow it\\'s Gale\\'s turn to be confused. Does she mean \\nit? Or is she messing with him? I\\'m guessing the \\nsecond. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You won\\'t be going to the Capitol,\" says Gale coolly. \\nHis eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her \\ndress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a \\nfamily in bread for months. \"What can you have? Five \\nentries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s not her fault,\" I say. \\n\\n\"No, it\\'s no one\\'s fault. Just the way it is,\" says Gale. \\nMadge\\'s face has become closed off. She puts the \\nmoney for the berries in my hand. \"Good luck, \\nKatniss.\" \"You, too,\" I say, and the door closes. \\n\\nWe walk toward the Seam in silence. I don\\'t like that \\nGale took a dig at Madge, but he\\'s right, of course. \\nThe reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting \\nthe worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the \\nday you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered \\nonce. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until \\nyou reach the age of eighteen, the final year of \\neligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven \\ntimes. That\\'s true for every citizen in all twelve \\ndistricts in the entire country of Panem. \\n\\nBut here\\'s the catch. Say you are poor and starving \\nas we were. You can opt to add your name more times \\nin exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a \\nmeager year\\'s supply of grain and oil for one person. \\nYou may do this for each of your family members as \\nwell. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered \\nfour times. Once, because I had to, and three times \\nfor tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my \\nmother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. \\nAnd the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of \\nsixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. \\nGale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or \\nsingle-handedly feeding a family of five for seven \\nyears, will have his name in forty-two times. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nYou can see why someone like Madge, who has never \\nbeen at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The \\nchance of her name being drawn is very slim \\ncompared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not \\nimpossible, but slim. And even though the rules were \\nset up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not \\nMadge\\'s family, it\\'s hard not to resent those who don\\'t \\nhave to sign up for tesserae. \\n\\nGale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On \\nother days, deep in the woods, I\\'ve listened to him \\nrant about how the tesserae are just another tool to \\ncause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred \\nbetween the starving workers of the Seam and those \\nwho can generally count on supper and thereby \\nensure we will never trust one another. \"It\\'s to the \\nCapitol\\'s advantage to have us divided among \\nourselves,\" he might say if there were no ears to hear \\nbut mine. If it wasn\\'t reaping day. If a girl with a gold \\npin and no tesserae had not made what I\\'m sure she \\nthought was a harmless comment. \\n\\nAs we walk, I glance over at Gale\\'s face, still \\nsmoldering underneath his stony expression. His \\nrages seem pointless to me, although I never say so. \\nIt\\'s not that I don\\'t agree with him. I do. But what \\ngood is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the \\nwoods? It doesn\\'t change anything. It doesn\\'t make \\nthings fair. It doesn\\'t fill our stomachs. In fact, it \\nscares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. \\nBetter he does it in the woods than in the district. \\n\\nGale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple \\nof loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of \\nstrawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for \\neach. \\n\\n\"See you in the square,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wear something pretty,\" he says flatly. \\n\\n\\n\\nAt home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. \\nMy mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary \\ndays. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and \\nruffled blouse. It\\'s a bit big on her, but my mother \\nhas made it stay with pins. Even so, she\\'s having \\ntrouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. \\n\\nA tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt \\nand sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To \\nmy surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own \\nlovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching \\nshoes. \\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" I ask. I\\'m trying to get past rejecting \\noffers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I \\nwouldn\\'t allow her to do anything for me. And this is \\nsomething special. Her clothes from her past are very \\nprecious to her. \\n\\n\"Of course. Let\\'s put your hair up, too,\" she says. I let \\nher towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can \\nhardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that \\nleans against the wall. \\n\\n\"You look beautiful,\" says Prim in a hushed voice. \\n\\n\"And nothing like myself,\" I say. I hug her, because I \\nknow these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her \\nfirst reaping. She\\'s about as safe as you can get, since \\nshe\\'s only entered once. I wouldn\\'t let her take out \\nany tesserae. But she\\'s worried about me. That the \\nunthinkable might happen. \\n\\nI protect Prim in every way I can, but I\\'m powerless \\nagainst the reaping. The anguish I always feel when \\nshe\\'s in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to \\nregister on my (ace. I notice her blouse has pulled out \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nof her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay \\ncalm. \"Tuck your tail in, little duck,\" I say, smoothing \\nthe blouse back in place. \\n\\nPrim giggles and gives me a small\"Quack.\" \\n\\n\"Quack yourself,\" I say with a light laugh. The kind \\nonly Prim can draw out of me. \"Come on, let\\'s eat,\" I \\nsay and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head. \\n\\nThe fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but \\nthat will be for supper. We decide to save the \\nstrawberries and bakery bread for this evening\\'s meal, \\nto make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from \\nPrim\\'s goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from \\nthe tessera grain, although no one has much appetite \\nanyway. \\n\\nAt one o\\'clock, we head for the square. Attendance is \\nmandatory unless you are on death\\'s door. This \\nevening, officials will come around and check to see if \\nthis is the case. If not, youll be imprisoned. \\n\\nIt\\'s too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the \\nsquare \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one of the few places in District 12 that can \\nbe pleasant. The square\\'s surrounded by shops, and \\non public market days, especially if there\\'s good \\nweather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite \\nthe bright banners hanging on the buildings, there\\'s \\nan air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like \\nbuzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. \\n\\nPeople file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a \\ngood opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the \\npopulation as well. Twelve- through eighteen-year- \\nolds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, \\nthe oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, \\ntoward the back. Family members line up around the \\nperimeter, holding tightly to one another\\'s hands. But \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthere are others, too, who have no one they love at \\nstake, or who no longer care, who slip among the \\ncrowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will \\nbe drawn. Odds are given on their ages, whether \\nthey\\'re Seam or merchant, if they will break down and \\nweep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but \\ncarefully, carefully. These same people tend to be \\ninformers, and who hasn\\'t broken the law? I could be \\nshot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of \\nthose in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim \\nthe same. \\n\\nAnyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose \\nbetween dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the \\nbullet would be much quicker. \\n\\nThe space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people \\narrive. The square\\'s quite large, but not enough to \\nhold District 12\\'s population of about eight thousand. \\nLatecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where \\nthey can watch the event on screens as it\\'s televised \\nlive by the state. \\n\\nI find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the \\nSeam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our \\nattention on the temporary stage that is set up before \\nthe Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, \\nand two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for \\nthe girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls\\' ball. \\nTwenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on \\nthem in careful handwriting. \\n\\nTwo of the three chairs fill with Madge\\'s father, Mayor \\nUndersee, who\\'s a tall, balding man, and Effie \\nTrinket, District 12\\'s escort, fresh from the Capitol \\nwith her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring \\ngreen suit. They murmur to each other and then look \\nwith concern at the empty seat. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nJust as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps \\nup to the podium and begins to read. It\\'s the same \\nstory every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the \\ncountry that rose up out of the ashes of a place that \\nwas once called North America. He lists the disasters, \\nthe droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching \\nseas that swallowed up so much of the land, the \\nbrutal war for what little sustenance remained. The \\nresult was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by \\nthirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity \\nto its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising \\nof the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were \\ndefeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of \\nTreason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace \\nand, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must \\nnever be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. \\n\\nThe rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In \\npunishment for the uprising, each of the twelve \\ndistricts must provide one girl and one boy, called \\ntributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will \\nbe imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold \\nanything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. \\nOver a period of several weeks, the competitors must \\nfight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. \\n\\nTaking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill \\none another while we watch \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this is the Capitol\\'s \\nway of reminding us how totally we are at their \\nmercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving \\nanother rebellion. \\n\\nWhatever words they use, the real message is \\nclear. \"Look how we take your children and sacrifice \\nthem and there\\'s nothing you can do. If you lift a \\nfinger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as \\nwe did in District Thirteen.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTo make it humiliating as well as torturous, the \\nCapitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a \\nfestivity, a sporting event pitting every district against \\nthe others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease \\nback home, and their district will be showered with \\nprizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol \\nwill show the winning district gifts of grain and oil \\nand even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us \\nbattle starvation. \\n\\n\"It is both a time for repentance and a time for \\nthanks,\" intones the mayor. \\n\\nThen he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In \\nseventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one \\nis still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle- \\naged man, who at this moment appears hollering \\nsomething unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and \\nfalls into the third chair. He\\'s drunk. Very. The crowd \\nresponds with its token applause, but he\\'s confused \\nand tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she \\nbarely manages to fend off. \\n\\nThe mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being \\ntelevised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of \\nPanem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the \\nattention back to the reaping by introducing Effie \\nTrinket. \\n\\nBright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the \\npodium and gives her signature, \"Happy Hunger \\nGames! And may the odds be ever in your favor!\" Her \\npink hair must be a wig because her curls have \\nshifted slightly off-center since her encounter with \\nHaymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is \\nto be here, although everyone knows she\\'s just aching \\nto get bumped up to a better district where they have \\nproper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of \\nthe entire nation. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me \\nwith a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at \\nleast has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly I \\nam thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that \\nbig glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. \\nNot compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe he\\'s \\nthinking the same thing about me because his face \\ndarkens and he turns away. \"But there are still \\nthousands of slips,\" I wish I could whisper to him. \\n\\nIt\\'s time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she \\nalways does, \"Ladies first!\"and crosses to the glass \\nball with the girls\\' names. She reaches in, digs her \\nhand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. \\nThe crowd draws in a collective breath and then you \\ncan hear a pin drop, and I\\'m feeling nauseous and so \\ndesperately hoping that it\\'s not me, that it\\'s not me, \\nthat it\\'s not me. \\n\\nEffie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes \\nthe slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear \\nvoice. And it\\'s not me. \\n\\nIt\\'s Primrose Everdeen. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nOne time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting \\nmotionless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell \\nten feet to the ground, landing on my back. It was as \\nif the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my \\nlungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, \\nto do anything. \\n\\nThat\\'s how I feel now, trying to remember how to \\nbreathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name \\nbounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is \\ngripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and I think \\nmaybe I started to fall and he caught me. \\n\\nThere must have been some mistake. This can\\'t be \\nhappening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! \\nHer chances of being chosen so remote that I\\'d not \\neven bothered to worry about her. Hadn\\'t I done \\neverything? Taken the tesserae, refused to let her do \\nthe same? One slip. One slip in thousands. The odds \\nhad been entirely in her favor. But it hadn\\'t mattered. \\n\\nSomewhere far away, I can hear the crowd \\nmurmuring unhappily as they always do when a \\ntwelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks \\nthis is fair. And then I see her, the blood drained from \\nher face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking \\nwith stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing \\nme, and I see the back of her blouse has become \\nuntucked and hangs out over her skirt. It\\'s this \\ndetail, the untucked blouse forming a ducktail, that \\nbrings me back to myself. \\n\\n\"Prim!\" The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and \\nmy muscles begin to move again. \"Prim!\" I don\\'t need \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nto shove through the crowd. The other kids make way \\nimmediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. \\nI reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. \\nWith one sweep of my arm, I push her behind me. \\n\\n\"I volunteer!\" I gasp. \"I volunteer as tribute!\" \\n\\nThere\\'s some confusion on the stage. District 12 \\nhasn\\'t had a volunteer in decades and the protocol \\nhas become rusty. The rule is that once a tribute\\'s \\nname has been pulled from the ball, another eligible \\nboy, if a boy\\'s name has been read, or girl, if a girl\\'s \\nname has been read, can step forward to take his or \\nher place. In some districts, in which winning the \\nreaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk \\ntheir lives, the volunteering is complicated. But in \\nDistrict 12, where the wordtribute is pretty much \\nsynonymous with the word corpse, volunteers are all \\nbut extinct. \\n\\n\"Lovely!\" says Effie Trinket. \"But I believe there\\'s a \\nsmall matter of introducing the reaping winner and \\nthen asking for volunteers, and if one does come forth \\nthen we, um ...\" she trails off, unsure herself. \\n\\n\"What does it matter?\" says the mayor. He\\'s looking \\nat me with a pained expression on his face. He \\ndoesn\\'t know me really, but there\\'s a faint recognition \\nthere. I am the girl who brings the strawberries. The \\ngirl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. \\nThe girl who five years ago stood huddled with her \\nmother and sister, as he presented her, the oldest \\nchild, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, \\nvaporized in the mines. Does he remember that? \\n\"What does it matter?\" he repeats gruffly. \"Let her \\ncome forward.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPrim is screaming hysterically behind me. She\\'s \\nwrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice. \"No, \\nKatniss! No! You can\\'t go!\" \\n\\n\"Prim, let go,\" I say harshly, because this is upsetting \\nme and I don\\'t want to cry. When they televise the \\nreplay of the reapings tonight, everyone will make \\nnote of my tears, and I\\'ll be marked as an easy target. \\nA weakling. I will give no one that satisfaction. \"Let \\ngo!\" \\n\\nI can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn \\nand see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and she\\'s \\nthrashing in his arms. \"Up you go, Catnip,\" he says, \\nin a voice he\\'s fighting to keep steady, and then he \\ncarries Prim off toward my mother. I steel myself and \\nclimb the steps. \\n\\n\"Well, bravo!\" gushes Effie Trinket. \"That\\'s the spirit \\nof the Games!\" She\\'s pleased to finally have a district \\nwith a little action going on in it. \"What\\'s your name?\" \\n\\nI swallow hard. \"Katniss Everdeen,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I bet my buttons that was your sister. Don\\'t want her \\nto steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! \\nLet\\'s give a big round of applause to our newest \\ntribute!\" trills Effie Trinket. \\n\\nTo the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, \\nnot one person claps. Not even the ones holding \\nbetting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. \\nPossibly because they know me from the Hob, or \\nknew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no \\none can help loving. So instead of acknowledging \\napplause, I stand there unmoving while they take part \\nin the boldest form of dissent they can manage. \\nSilence. Which says we do not agree. We do not \\ncondone. All of this is wrong. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nThen something unexpected happens. At least, I don\\'t \\nexpect it because I don\\'t think of District 12 as a \\nplace that cares about me. But a shift has occurred \\nsince I stepped up to take Prim\\'s place, and now it \\nseems I have become someone precious. At first one, \\nthen another, then almost every member of the crowd \\ntouches the three middle fingers of their left hand to \\ntheir lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and \\nrarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen \\nat funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it \\nmeans good-bye to someone you love. \\n\\nNow I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately \\nHaymitch chooses this time to come staggering across \\nthe stage to congratulate me. \"Look at her. Look at \\nthis one!\" he hollers, throwing an arm around my \\nshoulders. He\\'s surprisingly strong for such a wreck. \\n\"I like her!\" His breath reeks of liquor and it\\'s been a \\nlong time since he\\'s bathed. \"Lots of ...\" He can\\'t \\nthink of the word for a while. \"Spunk!\" he says \\ntriumphantly. \"More than you!\" he releases me and \\nstarts for the front of the stage. \"More than you!\" he \\nshouts, pointing directly into a camera. \\n\\nIs he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he \\nmight actually be taunting the Capitol? I\\'ll never \\nknow because just as he\\'s opening his mouth to \\ncontinue, Haymitch plummets off the stage and \\nknocks himself unconscious. \\n\\nHe\\'s disgusting, but I\\'m grateful. With every camera \\ngleefully trained on him, I have just enough time to \\nrelease the small, choked sound in my throat and \\ncompose myself. I put my hands behind my back and \\nstare into the distance. \\n\\nI can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale. \\nFor a moment, I yearn for something . . . the idea of us \\nleaving the district . . . making our way in the woods . . . \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nbut I know I was right about not running off. Because \\nwho else would have volunteered for Prim? \\n\\nHaymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie \\nTrinket is trying to get the ball rolling again. \"What an \\nexciting day!\" she warbles as she attempts to \\nstraighten her wig, which has listed severely to the \\nright. \"But more excitement to come! It\\'s time to \\nchoose our boy tribute!\" Clearly hoping to contain her \\ntenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her \\nhead as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys\\' \\nnames and grabs the first slip she encounters. She \\nzips back to the podium, and I don\\'t even have time to \\nwish for Gale\\'s safety when she\\'s reading the name. \\n\"Peeta Mellark.\" \\n\\nPeeta Mellark! \\n\\nOh, no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this \\nname, although I have never spoken directly to its \\nowner. Peeta Mellark. \\n\\nNo, the odds are not in my favor today. I watch him \\nas he makes his way toward the stage. Medium \\nheight, stocky build, ashy blond hair that falls in \\nwaves over \\n\\nhis forehead. The shock of the moment is registering \\non his face, you can see his struggle to remain \\nemotionless, but his blue eyes show the alarm I\\'ve \\nseen so often in prey. Yet he climbs steadily onto the \\nstage and takes his place. \\n\\nEffie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps \\nforward. He has two older brothers, I know, I\\'ve seen \\nthem in the bakery, but one is probably too old now \\nto volunteer and the other won\\'t. This is standard. \\nFamily devotion only goes so far for most people on \\nreaping day. What I did was the radical thing. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of \\nTreason as he does every year at this point \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s \\nrequired \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but I\\'m not listening to a word. \\n\\nWhy him? I think. Then I try to convince myself it \\ndoesn\\'t matter. Peeta Mellark and I are not friends. \\nNot even neighbors. We don\\'t speak. Our only real \\ninteraction happened years ago. He\\'s probably \\nforgotten it. But I haven\\'t and I know I never will... . \\n\\nIt was during the worst time. My father had been \\nkilled in the mine accident three months earlier in the \\nbitterest January anyone could remember. The \\nnumbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would \\nhit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my \\nbody with sobs. Where are you? I would cry out in my \\nmind. Where have you gone? Of course, there was \\nnever any answer. \\n\\nThe district had given us a small amount of money as \\ncompensation for his death, enough to cover one \\nmonth of grieving at which time my mother would be \\nexpected to get a job. Only she didn\\'t. She didn\\'t do \\nanything but sit propped up in a chair or, more often, \\nhuddled under the blankets on her bed, eyes fixed on \\nsome point in the distance. Once in a while, she\\'d \\nstir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only \\nto then collapse back into stillness. No amount of \\npleading from Prim seemed to affect her. \\n\\nI was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was \\nlocked in some dark world of sadness, but at the \\ntime, all I knew was that I had lost not only a father, \\nbut a mother as well. At eleven years old, with Prim \\njust seven, I took over as head of the family. There \\nwas no choice. I bought our food at the market and \\ncooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and \\nmyself looking presentable. Because if it had become \\nknown that my mother could no longer care for us, \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthe district would have taken us away from her and \\nplaced us in the community home. I\\'d grown up \\nseeing those home kids at school. The sadness, the \\nmarks of angry hands on their faces, the \\nhopelessness that curled their shoulders forward. I \\ncould never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim \\nwho cried when I cried before she even knew the \\nreason, who brushed and plaited my mother\\'s hair \\nbefore we left for school, who still polished my father\\'s \\nshaving mirror each night because he\\'d hated the \\nlayer of coal dust that settled on everything in the \\nSeam. The community home would crush her like a \\nbug. So I kept our predicament a secret. \\n\\nBut the money ran out and we were slowly starving to \\ndeath. There\\'s no other way to put it. I kept telling \\nmyself if I could only hold out until May, just May \\n8th, I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the \\ntesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed \\nus. Only there were still several weeks to go. We could \\nwell be dead by then. \\n\\nStarvation\\'s not an uncommon fate in District 12. \\nWho hasn\\'t seen the victims? Older people who can\\'t \\nwork. Children from a family with too many to feed. \\nThose injured in the mines. Straggling through the \\nstreets. And one day, you come upon them sitting \\nmotionless against a wall or lying in the Meadow, you \\nhear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers \\nare called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never \\nthe cause of death officially. It\\'s always the flu, or \\nexposure, or pneumonia. But that fools no one. \\n\\nOn the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, \\nthe rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had \\nbeen in town, trying to trade some threadbare old \\nbaby clothes of Prim\\'s in the public market, but there \\nwere no takers. Although I had been to the Hob on \\nseveral occasions with my father, I was too frightened \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nto venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain \\nhad soaked through my father\\'s hunting jacket, \\nleaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, we\\'d \\nhad nothing but boiled water with some old dried \\nmint leaves I\\'d found in the back of a cupboard. By \\nthe time the market closed, I was shaking so hard I \\ndropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle. \\nI didn\\'t pick it up for fear I would keel over and be \\nunable to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted \\nthose clothes. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t go home. Because at home was my mother \\nwith her dead eyes and my little sister, with her \\nhollow cheeks and cracked lips. I couldn\\'t walk into \\nthat room with the smoky fire from the damp \\nbranches I had scavenged at the edge of the woods \\nafter the coal had run out, my bands empty of any \\nhope. \\n\\nI found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind \\nthe shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The \\nmerchants live above their businesses, so I was \\nessentially in their backyards. I remember the \\noutlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring, \\na goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a post, \\nhunched defeated in the muck. \\n\\nAll forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. \\nPunishable by death. But it crossed my mind that \\nthere might be something in the trash bins, and those \\nwere fair game. Perhaps a bone at the butcher\\'s or \\nrotted vegetables at the grocer\\'s, something no one \\nbut my family was desperate enough to eat. \\nUnfortunately, the bins had just been emptied. \\n\\nWhen I passed the baker\\'s, the smell of fresh bread \\nwas so overwhelming I felt dizzy. The ovens were in \\nthe back, and a golden glow spilled out the open \\nkitchen door. I stood mesmerized by the heat and the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nluscious scent until the rain interfered, running its \\nicy fingers down my back, forcing me back to life. I \\nlifted the lid to the baker\\'s trash bin and found it \\nspotlessly, heartlessly bare. \\n\\nSuddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked \\nup to see the baker\\'s wife, telling me to move on and \\ndid I want her to call the Peacekeepers and how sick \\nshe was of having those brats from the Seam pawing \\nthrough her trash. The words were ugly and I had no \\ndefense. As I carefully replaced the lid and backed \\naway, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering out \\nfrom behind his mother\\'s back. I\\'d seen him at \\nschool. He was in my year, but I didn\\'t know his \\nname. He stuck with the town kids, so how would I? \\nHis mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but \\nhe must have been watching me as I made my way \\nbehind the pen that held their pig and leaned against \\nthe far side of an old apple tree. The realization that \\nI\\'d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My \\nknees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its \\nroots. It was too much. I was too sick and weak and \\ntired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and \\ntake us to the community home, I thought. Or better \\nyet, let me die right here in the rain. \\n\\nThere was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the \\nwoman screaming again and the sound of a blow, and \\nI vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed \\ntoward me through the mud and I thought, It\\'s her. \\nShe\\'s coming to drive me away with a stick. But it \\nwasn\\'t her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried two \\nlarge loaves of bread that must have fallen into the \\nfire because the crusts were scorched black. \\n\\nHis mother was yelling, \"Feed it to the pig, you stupid \\ncreature! Why not? No one decent will buy burned \\nbread!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHe began to tear off chunks from the burned parts \\nand toss them into the trough, and the front bakery \\nbell rung and the mother disappeared to help a \\ncustomer. \\n\\nThe boy never even glanced my way, but I was \\nwatching him. Because of the bread, because of the \\nred weal that stood out on his cheekbone. What had \\nshe hit him with? \\n\\nMy parents never hit us. I couldn\\'t even imagine it. \\nThe boy took one look back to the bakery as if \\nchecking that the coast was clear, then, his attention \\nback on the pig, he threw a loaf of bread in my \\ndirection. The second quickly followed, and he \\nsloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door \\ntightly behind him. \\n\\nI stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, \\nperfect really, except for the burned areas. Did he \\nmean for me to have them? He must have. Because \\nthere they were at my feet. Before anyone could \\nwitness what had happened I shoved the loaves up \\nunder my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly \\nabout me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the \\nbread burned into my skin, but I clutched it tighter, \\nclinging to life. \\n\\nBy the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled \\nsomewhat, but the insides were still warm. When I \\ndropped them on the table, Prim\\'s hands reached to \\ntear off a chunk, but I made her sit, forced my mother \\nto join us at the table, and poured warm tea. I \\nscraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread. We \\nate an entire loaf, slice by slice. It was good hearty \\nbread, filled with raisins and nuts. \\n\\nI put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, \\nand fell into a dreamless sleep. It didn\\'t occur to me \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nuntil the next morning that the boy might have \\nburned the bread on purpose. Might have dropped \\nthe loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being \\npunished, and then delivered them to me. But I \\ndismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why \\nwould he have done it? He didn\\'t even know me. Still, \\njust throwing me the bread was an enormous \\nkindness that would have surely resulted in a beating \\nif discovered. 1 couldn\\'t explain his actions. \\n\\nWe ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to \\nschool. It was as if spring had come overnight. Warm \\nsweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, I passed the boy in \\nthe hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had \\nblackened. He was with his friends and didn\\'t \\nacknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim \\nand started for home that afternoon, I found him \\nstaring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes \\nmet for only a second, then he turned his head away. \\nI dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and that\\'s when I \\nsaw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off \\nin my head. I thought of the hours spent in the woods \\nwith my father and I knew how we were going to \\nsurvive. \\n\\nTo this day, I can never shake the connection between \\nthis boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me \\nhope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was \\nnot doomed. And more than once, I have turned in \\nthe school hallway and caught his eyes trained on \\nme, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him \\nsomething, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had \\nthanked him at some point, I\\'d be feeling less \\nconflicted now. I thought about it a couple of times, \\nbut the opportunity never seemed to present itself. \\nAnd now it never will. Because we\\'re going to be \\nthrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly \\nhow am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSomehow it just won\\'t seem sincere if I\\'m trying to slit \\nhis throat. \\n\\nThe mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and \\nmotions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as \\nsolid and warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks \\nme right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is \\nmeant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe it\\'s just a \\nnervous spasm. \\n\\nWe turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of \\nPanem plays. \\n\\nOh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds \\nare someone else will kill him before I do. \\n\\nOf course, the odds have not been very dependable of \\nlate. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe moment the anthem ends, we are taken into \\ncustody. I don\\'t mean we\\'re handcuffed or anything, \\nbut a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the \\nfront door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes \\nhave tried to escape in the past. I\\'ve never seen that \\nhappen though. \\n\\nOnce inside, I\\'m conducted to a room and left alone. \\nIt\\'s the richest place I\\'ve ever been in, with thick, deep \\ncarpets and a velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet \\nbecause my mother has a dress with a collar made of \\nthe stuff. When I sit on the couch, I can\\'t help \\nrunning my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It helps \\nto calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The \\ntime allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their \\nloved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this \\nroom with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an \\noption. There will be more cameras at the train \\nstation. \\n\\nMy sister and my mother come first. I reach out to \\nPrim and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my \\nneck, head on my shoulder, just like she did when \\nshe was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and \\nwraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say \\nnothing. Then I start telling them all the things they \\nmust remember to do, now that I will not be there to \\ndo them for them. \\n\\nPrim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if \\nthey\\'re careful, on selling Prim\\'s goat milk and cheese \\nand the small apothecary business my mother now \\nruns for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the \\nherbs she doesn\\'t grow herself, but she must be very \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ncareful to describe them because he\\'s not as familiar \\nwith them as I am. He\\'ll also bring them game \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he \\nand I made a pact about this a year or so ago \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and \\nwill probably not ask for compensation, but they \\nshould thank him with some kind of trade, like milk \\nor medicine. \\n\\nI don\\'t bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to \\nteach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The \\nwoods terrified her, and whenever I shot something, \\nshe\\'d get teary and talk about how we might be able \\nto heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she \\nmakes out well with her goat, so I concentrate on \\nthat. \\n\\nWhen I am done with instructions about fuel, and \\ntrading, and staying in school, I turn to my mother \\nand grip her arm, hard. \"Listen to me. Are you \\nlistening to me?\" She nods, alarmed by my intensity. \\nShe must know what\\'s coming. \"You can\\'t leave \\nagain,\" I say. \\n\\nMy mother\\'s eyes find the floor. \"I know. I won\\'t. I \\ncouldn\\'t help what \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"Well, you have to help it this time. You can\\'t clock \\nout and leave Prim on her own. There\\'s no me now to \\nkeep you both alive. It doesn\\'t matter what happens. \\nWhatever you see on the screen. You have to promise \\nme you\\'ll fight through it!\" My voice has risen to a \\nshout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt at her \\nabandonment. \\n\\nShe pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger \\nherself now. \"I was ill. I could have treated myself if \\nI\\'d had the medicine I have now.\" \\n\\nThat part about her being ill might be true. I\\'ve seen \\n\\nher bring back people suffering from immobilizing \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nsadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but it\\'s one \\nwe can\\'t afford. \\n\\n\"Then take it. And take care of her!\" I say. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be all right, Katniss,\" says Prim, clasping my face \\nin her hands. \"But you have to take care, too. You\\'re \\nso fast and brave. Maybe you can win.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t win. Prim must know that in her heart. The \\ncompetition will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from \\nwealthier districts, where winning is a huge honor, \\nwho\\'ve been trained their whole lives for this. Boys \\nwho are two to three times my size. Girls who know \\ntwenty different ways to kill you with a knife. Oh, \\nthereH be people like me, too. People to weed out \\nbefore the real fun begins. \\n\\n\"Maybe,\" I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to \\ncarry on if I\\'ve already given up myself. Besides, it \\nisn\\'t in my nature to go down without a fight, even \\nwhen things seem insurmountable. \"Then we\\'d be \\nrich as Haymitch.\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t care if we\\'re rich. I just want you to come \\nhome. You will try, won\\'t you? Really, really try?\" asks \\nPrim. \\n\\n\"Really, really try. I swear it,\" I say. And I know, \\nbecause of Prim, I\\'ll have to. \\n\\nAnd then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our \\ntime is up, and we\\'re all hugging one another so hard \\nit hurts and all I\\'m saying is \"I love you. I love you \\nboth.\" And they\\'re saying it back and then the \\nPeacekeeper orders them out and the door closes. I \\nbury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this \\ncan block the whole thing out. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSomeone else enters the room, and when I look up, \\nI\\'m surprised to see it\\'s the baker, Peeta Mellark\\'s \\nfather. I can\\'t believe he\\'s come to visit me. After all, \\nI\\'ll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each \\nother a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she \\nsells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of \\nthem aside for him and he gives her a generous \\namount of bread in return. We always wait to trade \\nwith him when his witch of a wife isn\\'t around \\nbecause he\\'s so much nicer. I feel certain he would \\nnever have hit his son the way she did over the \\nburned bread. But why has he come to see me? \\n\\nThe baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the \\nplush chairs. He\\'s a big, broad-shouldered man with \\nburn scars from years at the ovens. He must have \\njust said goodbye to his son. \\n\\nHe pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket \\nand holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. \\nThese are a luxury we can never afford. \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" I say. The baker\\'s not a very talkative \\nman in the best of times, and today he has no words \\nat all. \"I had some of your bread this morning. My \\nfriend Gale gave you a squirrel for it.\" He nods, as if \\nremembering the squirrel. \"Not your best trade,\" I say. \\nHe shrugs as if it couldn\\'t possibly matter. \\n\\nThen I can\\'t think of anything else, so we sit in silence \\nuntil a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and \\ncoughs to clear his throat. \"Ill keep an eye on the \\nlittle girl. Make sure she\\'s eating.\" \\n\\nI feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his \\nwords. People deal with me, but they are genuinely \\nfond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to \\nkeep her alive. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMy next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks \\nstraight to me. She is not weepy or evasive, instead \\nthere\\'s an urgency about her tone that surprises me. \\n\"They let you wear one thing from your district in the \\narena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you \\nwear this?\" She holds out the circular gold pin that \\nwas on her dress earlier. I hadn\\'t paid much attention \\nto it before, but now I see it\\'s a small bird in flight. \\n\\n\"Your pin?\" I say. Wearing a token from my district is \\nabout the last thing on my mind. \\n\\n\"Here, I\\'ll put it on your dress, all right?\" Madge \\ndoesn\\'t wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes \\nthe bird to my dress. \"Promise youll wear it into the \\narena, Katniss?\" she asks. \"Promise?\" \\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say. Cookies. A pin. I\\'m getting all kinds of \\ngifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the \\ncheek. Then she\\'s gone and I\\'m left thinking that \\nmaybe Madge really has been my friend all along. \\n\\nFinally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing \\nromantic between us, but when he opens his arms I \\ndon\\'t hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to \\nme \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, \\neven the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet \\nmoments on a hunt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but this is the first time I \\nreally feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own. \\n\\n\"Listen,\" he says. \"Getting a knife should be pretty \\neasy, but you\\'ve got to get your hands on a bow. \\nThat\\'s your best chance.\" \\n\\n\"They don\\'t always have bows,\" I say, thinking of the \\nyear there were only horrible spiked maces that the \\ntributes had to bludgeon one another to death with. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then make one,\" says Gale. \"Even a weak bow is \\nbetter than no bow at all.\" \\n\\nI have tried copying my father\\'s bows with poor \\nresults. It\\'s not that easy. Even he had to scrap his \\nown work sometimes. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t even know if there\\'ll be wood,\" I say. Another \\nyear, they tossed everybody into a landscape of \\nnothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. I \\nparticularly hated that year. Many contestants were \\nbitten by venomous snakes or went insane from \\nthirst. \\n\\n\"There\\'s almost always some wood,\" Gale says. \"Since \\nthat year half of them died of cold. Not much \\nentertainment in that.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the \\nplayers freeze to death at night. You could hardly see \\nthem because they were just huddled in balls and \\nhad no wood for fires or torches or anything. It was \\nconsidered very anti-climactic in the Capitol, all those \\nquiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, there\\'s usually \\nbeen wood to make fires. \\n\\n\"Yes, there\\'s usually some,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Katniss, it\\'s just hunting. You\\'re the best hunter I \\nknow,\" says Gale. \\n\\n\"It\\'s not just hunting. They\\'re armed. They think,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"So do you. And you\\'ve had more practice. Real \\npractice,\" he says. \"You know how to kill.\" \\n\\n\"Not people,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"How different can it be, really?\" says Gale grimly. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe awful thing is that if I can forget they\\'re people, it \\nwill be no different at all. \\n\\nThe Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for \\nmore time, but they\\'re taking him away and I start to \\npanic. \"Don\\'t let them starve!\" I cry out, clinging to \\nhis hand. \\n\\n\"I won\\'t! You know I won\\'t! Katniss, remember I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he \\nsays, and they yank us apart and slam the door and \\n111 never know what it was he wanted me to \\nremember. \\n\\nIt\\'s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train \\nstation. I\\'ve never been in a car before. Rarely even \\nridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot. \\n\\nI\\'ve been right not to cry. The station is swarming \\nwith reporters with their insectlike cameras trained \\ndirectly on my face. But I\\'ve had a lot of practice at \\nwiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I \\ncatch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on \\nthe wall that\\'s airing my arrival live and feel gratified \\nthat I appear almost bored. \\n\\nPeeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been \\ncrying and interestingly enough does not seem to be \\ntrying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will \\nbe his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and \\nfrightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no \\ncompetition at all, and then come out fighting. This \\nworked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from \\nDistrict 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a \\nsniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about \\nher until there were only a handful of contestants left. \\nIt turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the \\nway she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta Mellark because he\\'s a baker\\'s son. All those \\nyears of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays \\naround have made him broad-shouldered and strong. \\nIt will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone \\nto overlook him. \\n\\nWe have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of \\nthe train while the cameras gobble up our images, \\nthen we\\'re allowed inside and the doors close \\nmercifully behind us. The train begins to move at \\nonce. \\n\\nThe speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, \\nI\\'ve never been on a train, as travel between the \\ndistricts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned \\nduties. For us, that\\'s mainly transporting coal. But \\nthis is no ordinary coal train. It\\'s one of the high- \\nspeed Capitol models that average 250 miles per \\nhour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a \\nday. \\n\\nIn school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place \\nonce called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region \\nknown is Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, \\nthey mined coal here. Which is why our miners have \\nto dig so deep. \\n\\nSomehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides \\nbasic reading and math most of our instruction is \\ncoal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the \\nhistory of Panem. It\\'s mostly a lot of blather about \\nwhat we owe the Capitol. I know there must be more \\nthan they\\'re telling us, an actual account of what \\nhappened during the rebellion. But I don\\'t spend \\nmuch time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I \\ndon\\'t see how it will help me get food on the table. \\n\\nThe tribute train is fancier than even the room in the \\n\\nJustice Building. We are each given our own \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nchambers that have a bedroom, a dressing area, and \\na private bathroom with hot and cold running water. \\nWe don\\'t have hot water at home, unless we boil it. \\n\\nThere are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie \\nTrinket tells me to do anything I want, wear anything \\nI want, everything is at my disposal. Just be ready for \\nsupper in an hour. I peel off my mother\\'s blue dress \\nand take a hot shower. I\\'ve never had a shower \\nbefore. It\\'s like being in a summer rain, only warmer. \\nI dress in a dark green shirt and pants. \\n\\nAt the last minute, I remember Madge\\'s little gold pin. \\nFor the first time, I get a good look at it. It\\'s as if \\nsomeone fashioned a small golden bird and then \\nattached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the \\nring only by its wing tips. I suddenly recognize it. A \\nmockingj ay. \\n\\nThey\\'re funny birds and something of a slap in the \\nface to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol \\nbred a series of genetically altered animals as \\nweapons. The common term for them was muttations, \\nor sometimesmuttsfor short. One was a special bird \\ncalled a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize \\nand repeat whole human conversations. They were \\nhoming birds, exclusively male, that were released \\ninto regions where the Capitol\\'s enemies were known \\nto be hiding. After the birds gathered words, they\\'d fly \\nback to centers to be recorded. It took people awhile \\nto realize what was going on in the districts, how \\nprivate conversations were being transmitted. Then, \\nof course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and \\nthe joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and \\nthe birds were abandoned to die off in the wild. \\n\\nOnly they didn\\'t die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated \\nwith female mockingbirds creating a whole new \\nspecies that could replicate both bird whistles and \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nhuman melodies. They had lost the ability to \\nenunciate words but could still mimic a range of \\nhuman vocal sounds, from a child\\'s high-pitched \\nwarble to a man\\'s deep tones. And they could re- \\ncreate songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs \\nwith multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing \\nthem and if they liked your voice. \\n\\nMy father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When \\nwe went hunting, he would whistle or sing \\ncomplicated songs to them and, after a polite pause, \\nthey\\'d always sing back. Not everyone is treated with \\nsuch respect. But whenever my father sang, all the \\nbirds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice \\nwas that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with \\nlife it made you want to laugh and cry at the same \\ntime. I could never bring myself to continue the \\npractice after he was gone. Still, there\\'s something \\ncomforting about the little bird. It\\'s like having a piece \\nof my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin \\nonto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a \\nbackground, I can almost imagine the mockingjay \\nflying through the trees. \\n\\nEffie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow \\nher through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining \\nroom with polished paneled walls. There\\'s a table \\nwhere all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta \\nMellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him \\nempty. \\n\\n\"Where\\'s Haymitch?\" asks Effie Trinket brightly. \\n\\n\"Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a \\nnap,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s been an exhausting day,\" says Effie Trinket. \\nI think she\\'s relieved by Haymitch \\'s absence, and who \\ncan blame her? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, \\ngreen salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese \\nand fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, \\nEffie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space \\nbecause there\\'s more to come. But I\\'m stuffing myself \\nbecause I\\'ve never had food like this, so good and so \\nmuch, and because probably the best thing I can do \\nbetween now and the Games is put on a few pounds. \\n\\n\"At least, you two have decent manners,\" says Effie as \\nwe\\'re finishing the main course. \"The pair last year \\nate everything with their hands like a couple of \\nsavages. It completely upset my digestion.\" \\n\\nThe pair last year were two kids from the Seam who\\'d \\nnever, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. \\nAnd when they did have food, table manners were \\nsurely the last thing on their minds. Peeta\\'s a baker\\'s \\nson. My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly, so \\nyes, I can handle a fork and knife. But I hate Effie \\nTrinket\\'s comment so much I make a point of eating \\nthe rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my \\nhands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her \\nlips tightly together. \\n\\nNow that the meal\\'s over, I\\'m fighting to keep the food \\ndown. I can see Peeta\\'s looking a little green, too. \\nNeither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But \\nif I can hold down Greasy Sae\\'s concoction of mice \\nmeat, pig entrails, and tree bark \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a winter specialty \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\'m determined to hang on to this. \\n\\nWe go to another compartment to watch the recap of \\nthe reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them \\nthroughout the day so a person could conceivably \\nwatch the whole thing live, but only people in the \\nCapitol could really do that, since none of them have \\nto attend reapings themselves. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nOne by one, we see the other reapings, the names \\ncalled, (the volunteers stepping forward or, more \\noften, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will \\nbe our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A \\nmonstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from \\nDistrict 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from \\nDistrict 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. \\nAnd most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from \\nDistrict 1 1 . She has dark brown skin and eyes, but \\nother than that, she\\'s very like Prim in size and \\ndemeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they \\nask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind \\nwhistling through the decrepit buildings around her. \\nThere\\'s no one willing to take her place. \\n\\nLast of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, \\nme running forward to volunteer. You can\\'t miss the \\ndesperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as \\nif I\\'m afraid no one will hear and they 11 take Prim \\naway. But, of course, they do hear. I see Gale pulling \\nher off me and watch myself mount the stage. The \\ncommentators are not sure what to say about the \\ncrowd\\'s refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One \\nsays that District 12 has always been a bit backward \\nbut that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, \\nHaymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. \\nPeeta\\'s name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. \\nWe shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and \\nthe pro-gram ends. \\n\\nEffie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig \\nwas in. \"Your mentor has a lot to learn about \\npresentation. A lot about televised behavior.\" \\n\\nPeeta unexpectedly laughs. \"He was drunk,\" says \\nPeeta.\"He\\'s drunk every year.\" \\n\\n\"Every day,\" I add. I can\\'t help smirking a little. Effie \\n\\nTrinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nsomewhat rough manners that could be corrected \\nwith a few tips from her. \\n\\n\"Yes,\" hisses Effie Trinket. \"How odd you two find it \\namusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the \\nworld in these Games. The one who advises you, lines \\nup your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of \\nany gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between \\nyour life and your death!\" \\n\\nJust then, Haymitch staggers into the compartment. \\n\"I miss supper?\" he says in a slurred voice. Then he \\nvomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the \\nmess. \\n\\n\"So laugh away!\" says Effie Trinket. She hops in her \\npointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the \\nroom. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nFor a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of \\nour mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff \\nfrom his stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits \\nalmost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance. \\nObviously Haymitch isn\\'t much, but Effie Trinket is \\nright about one thing, once we\\'re in the arena he\\'s all \\nwe\\'ve got. As if by some unspoken agreement, Peeta \\nand I each take one of Haymitch \\'s arms and help him \\nto his feet. \\n\\n\"I tripped?\" Haymitch asks. \"Smells bad.\" He wipes \\nhis hand on his nose, smearing his face with vomit. \\n\\n\"Let\\'s get you back to your room,\" says Peeta. \"Clean \\nyou up a bit.\" \\n\\nWe half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his \\ncompartment. Since we can\\'t exactly set him down on \\nthe embroidered bedspread, we haul him into the \\nbathtub and turn the shower on him. He hardly \\nnotices. \\n\\n\"It\\'s okay,\" Peeta says to me. \"Ill take it from here.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t help feeling a little grateful since the last thing \\nI want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit \\nout of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly \\nPeeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to \\nbe his favorite once the Games begin. But judging by \\nthe state he\\'s in, Haymitch will have no memory of \\nthis tomorrow. \\n\\n\"All right,\" I say. \"I can send one of the Capitol people \\nto help you.\" There\\'s any number on the train. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nCooking lor us. Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking \\ncare of us is their job. \\n\\n\"No. I don\\'t want them,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI nod and head to my own room. I understand how \\nPeeta feels. I can\\'t stand the sight of the Capitol \\npeople myself. But making them deal with Haymitch \\nmight be a small form of revenge. So I\\'m pondering \\nthe reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch \\nand all of a sudden I think, It\\'s because he\\'s being \\nkind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread. \\n\\nThe idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is \\nfar more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind \\npeople have a way of working their way inside me and \\nrooting there. And I can\\'t let Peeta do this. Not where \\nwe\\'re going. So I decide, from this moment on, to have \\nas little as possible to do with the baker\\'s son. \\n\\nWhen I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a \\nplatform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the \\ncookies Peeta\\'s father gave me out of the train, and \\nslam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of \\nthem. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground \\nand bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the \\ntrack. I only see the image for a moment, because the \\ntrain is off again, but it\\'s enough. Enough to remind \\nme of that other dandelion in the school yard years \\nago ... \\n\\nI had just turned away from Peeta Mellark\\'s bruised \\nface when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope \\nwasn\\'t lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I \\ngrabbed a bucket and Prim\\'s hand and headed to the \\nMeadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden- \\nheaded weeds. After we\\'d harvested those, we \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nscrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile \\nuntil we\\'d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, \\nstems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves \\non dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread. \\n\\n\"What else?\" Prim asked me. \"What other food can we \\nfind?\" \\n\\n\"All kinds of things,\" I promised her. \"I just have to \\nremember them.\" \\n\\nMy mother had a book she\\'d brought with her from \\nthe apothecary shop. The pages were made of old \\nparchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. \\nNeat handwritten blocks told their names, where to \\ngather them, when they came in bloom, their medical \\nuses. But my father added other entries to the book. \\nPlants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, \\nwild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the \\nnight poring over those pages. \\n\\nThe next day, we were off school. For a while I hung \\naround the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked \\nup the courage to go under the fence. It was the first \\ntime I\\'d been there alone, without my father\\'s \\nweapons to protect me. But I retrieved the small bow \\nand arrows he\\'d made me from a hollow tree. I \\nprobably didn\\'t go more than twenty yards into the \\nwoods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the \\nbranches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. \\nAfter several hours, I had the good luck to kill a \\nrabbit. \\n\\nI\\'d shot a few rabbits before, with my father\\'s \\nguidance. But this I\\'d done on my own. \\n\\nWe hadn\\'t had meat in months. The sight of the \\nrabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She \\nroused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nwith the meat and some more greens Prim had \\ngathered. Then she acted confused and went back to \\nbed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a \\nbowl. \\n\\nThe woods became our savior, and each day I went a \\nbit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but \\nI was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, \\ncaught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a \\nsquirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various \\nplants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are \\ntricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and \\nyou\\'re dead. I checked and double-checked the plants \\nI harvested with my father\\'s pictures. I kept us alive. \\n\\nAny sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable \\nbreak of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at \\nfirst. Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the \\nwild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on. Bears \\nand cats lived deeper in, perhaps disliking the sooty \\nreek of our district. \\n\\nOn May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up \\nfor my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of \\ngrain and oil in Prim\\'s toy wagon. On the eighth of \\nevery month, I wasentitled to do the same. I couldn\\'t \\nstop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was \\nnot enough to live on, and there were other things to \\nbuy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn\\'t \\nabsolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It \\nwas frightening to enter that place without my father \\nat my side, but people had respected him, and they \\naccepted me. Game was game after all, no matter \\nwho\\'d shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the \\nwealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my \\nfather had told me and learning a few new tricks as \\nwell. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not \\nsquirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only \\ntrade for one if his wife wasn\\'t around. The Head \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPeacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a \\npassion for strawberries. \\n\\nIn late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I \\nnoticed the plants growing around me. Tall with \\nleaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white \\npetals. I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging \\ninto the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the \\nroots. Small, bluish tubers that don\\'t look like much \\nbut boiled or baked are as good as any potato. \\n\"Katniss,\" I said aloud. It\\'s the plant I was named for. \\nAnd I heard my father\\'s voice joking, \"As long as you \\ncan find yourself, you\\'ll never starve.\" I spent hours \\nstirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, \\ngathering the tubers that floated to the top. That \\nnight, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we \\nwere all, for the first time in months, full. \\n\\nSlowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean \\nand cook and preserve some of the food I brought in \\nfor winter. People traded us or paid money for her \\nmedical remedies. One day, I heard her singing. \\n\\nPrim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept \\nwatching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I \\ndidn\\'t trust her. And some small gnarled place inside \\nme hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for \\nthe months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, \\nbut I had taken a step back from my mother, put up a \\nwall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing \\nwas ever the same between us again. \\n\\nNow I was going to die without that ever being set \\nright. I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the \\nJustice Building. I had told her I loved her, too, \\nthough. So maybe it would all balance out. \\n\\nFor a while I stand staring out the train window, \\n\\nwishing I could open it again, but unsure of what \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nwould happen at such high speed. In the distance, I \\nsee the lights of another district. 7? 10? I don\\'t know. \\nI think about the people in their houses, settling in \\nfor bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn \\ntight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? \\nWere they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the \\nstrawberries? Or did it lay untouched on their plates? \\nDid they watch the recap of the day\\'s events on the \\nbattered old TV that sits on the table against the \\nwall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my mother \\nholding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already \\nstarted to slip away, leaving the weight of the world \\non my sister\\'s fragile shoulders? \\n\\nPrim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. \\nThe thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting \\nhimself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me. If \\nshe cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl \\nup there until she calms down and falls asleep. I\\'m so \\nglad I didn\\'t drown him. \\n\\nImagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. \\nThis day has been endless. Could Gale and I have \\nbeen eating blackberries only this morning? It seems \\nlike a lifetime ago. Like a long dream that deteriorated \\ninto a nightmare. Maybe, if I go to sleep, I will wake \\nup back in District 12, where I belong. \\n\\nProbably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, \\nbut I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into \\nbed in my underwear. The sheets are made of soft, \\nsilky fabric. A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate \\nwarmth. \\n\\nIf I\\'m going to cry, now is the time to do it. By \\nmorning, 111 be able to wash the damage done by the \\ntears from my face. But no tears come. I\\'m too tired or \\ntoo numb to cry. The only thing I feel is a desire to be \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nsomewhere else. So I let the train rock me into \\noblivion. \\n\\n\\n\\nGray light is leaking through the curtains when the \\nrapping rouses me. I hear Effie Trinket\\'s voice, calling \\nme to rise. \"Up, up, up! It\\'s going to be a big, big, big \\nday!\" I try and imagine, for a moment, what it must \\nbe like inside that woman\\'s head. What thoughts fill \\nher waking hours? What dreams come to her at \\nnight? I have no idea. \\n\\nI put the green outfit back on since it\\'s not really \\ndirty, just slightly crumpled from spending the night \\non the floor. My fingers trace the circle around the \\nlittle gold mockingj ay and I think of the woods, and of \\nmy father, and of my mother and Prim waking up, \\nhaving to get on with things. \\n\\nI slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for \\nthe reaping and it doesn\\'t look too bad, so I just leave \\nit up. It doesn\\'t matter. We can\\'t be far from the \\nCapitol now. And once we reach the city, my stylist \\nwill dictate my look for the opening ceremonies \\ntonight anyway. I just hope I get one who doesn\\'t \\nthink nudity is the last word in fashion. \\n\\nAs I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me \\nwith a cup of black coffee. She\\'s muttering obscenities \\nunder her breath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red \\nfrom the previous day\\'s indulgences, is chuckling. \\nPeeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed. \\n\\n\"Sit down! Sit down!\" says Haymitch, waving me over. \\nThe moment I slide into my chair I\\'m served an \\nenormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried \\npotatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. \\nThe basket of rolls they set before me would keep my \\nfamily going for a week. There\\'s an elegant glass of \\norange juice. At least, I think it\\'s orange juice. I\\'ve \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nonly even tasted an orange once, at New Year\\'s when \\nmy father bought one as a special treat. A cup of \\ncoffee. My mother adores coffee, which we could \\nalmost never afford, but it only tastes bitter and thin \\nto me. A rich brown cup of something I\\'ve never seen. \\n\\n\"They call it hot chocolate,\" says Peeta. \"It\\'s good.\" \\n\\nI take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a \\nshudder runs through me. Even though the rest of \\nthe meal beckons, I ignore it until I\\'ve drained my \\ncup. Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold, \\nwhich is a substantial amount, being careful to not \\noverdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother \\ntold me that I always eat like 111 never see food again. \\nAnd I said, \"I won\\'t unless I bring it home.\" That shut \\nher up. \\n\\nWhen my stomach feels like it\\'s about to split open, I \\nlean back and take in my breakfast companions. \\nPeeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and \\ndipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn\\'t paid \\nmuch attention to his platter, but he\\'s knocking back \\na glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear \\nliquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it\\'s some \\nkind of spirit. I don\\'t know Haymitch, but I\\'ve seen \\nhim often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of \\nmoney on the counter of the woman who sells white \\nliquor. He\\'ll be incoherent by the time we reach the \\nCapitol. \\n\\nI realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 \\ntributes never stand a chance. It isn\\'t just that we\\'ve \\nbeen underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes \\nhave still been strong enough to make a go of it. But \\nwe rarely get sponsors and he\\'s a big part of the \\nreason why. The rich people who back tributes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\neither because they\\'re betting on them or simply for \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthe bragging rights of picking a winner \\xe2\\x80\\x94 expect \\nsomeone classier than Haymitch to deal with. \\n\\n\"So, you\\'re supposed to give us advice,\" I say to \\nHaymitch. \\n\\n\"Here\\'s some advice. Stay alive,\" says Haymitch, and \\nthen bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with \\nPeeta before I remember I\\'m having nothing more to \\ndo with him. I\\'m surprised to see the hardness in his \\neyes. He generally seems so mild. \\n\\n\"That\\'s very funny,\" says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes \\nout at the glass in Haymitch \\'s hand. It shatters on the \\nfloor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the \\nback of the train. \"Only not to us.\" \\n\\nHaymitch considers this a moment, then punches \\nPeeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When \\nhe turns back to reach for the spirits, I drive my knife \\ninto the table between his hand and the bottle, barely \\nmissing his fingers. I brace myself to deflect his hit, \\nbut it doesn\\'t come. Instead he sits back and squints \\nat us. \\n\\n\"Well, what\\'s this?\" says Haymitch. \"Did I actually get \\na pair of fighters this year?\" \\n\\nPeeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of \\nice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to \\nthe red mark on his jaw. \\n\\n\"No,\" says Haymitch, stopping him. \"Let the bruise \\nshow. The audience will think you\\'ve mixed it up with \\nanother tribute before you\\'ve even made it to the \\narena.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s against the rules,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you \\nfought, you weren\\'t caught, even better,\" says \\nHaymitch. He turns to me. \"Can you hit anything \\nwith that knife besides a table?\" \\n\\nThe bow and arrow is my weapon. But I\\'ve spent a \\nfair amount of time throwing knives as well. \\nSometimes, if I\\'ve wounded an animal with an arrow, \\nit\\'s better to get a knife into it, too, before I approach \\nit. I realize that if I want Haymitch \\'s attention, this is \\nmy moment to make an impression. I yank the knife \\nout of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then \\nthrow it into the wall across the room. I was actually \\njust hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in \\nthe seam between two panels, making me look a lot \\nbetter than I am. \\n\\n\"Stand over here. Both of you,\" says Haymitch, \\nnodding to the middle of the room. We obey and he \\ncircles us, prodding us like animals at times, \\nchecking our muscles, examining our faces. \"Well, \\nyou\\'re not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once the \\nstylists get hold of you, youll be attractive enough.\" \\n\\nPeeta and I don\\'t question this. The Hunger Games \\naren\\'t a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes \\nalways seem to pull more sponsors. \\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll make a deal with you. You don\\'t \\ninterfere with my drinking, and 111 stay sober enough \\nto help you,\" says Haymitch. \"But you have to do \\nexactly what I say.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s not much of a deal but still a giant step forward \\nfrom ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all. \\n\\n\"Fine,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"So help us,\" I say. \"When we get to the arena, what\\'s \\nthe best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"One thing at a time. In a few minutes, well be \\npulling into the station. Youll be put in the hands of \\nyour stylists. You\\'re not going to like what they do to \\nyou. But no matter what it is, don\\'t resist,\" says \\nHaymitch. \\n\\n\"But \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" I begin. \\n\\n\"No buts. Don\\'t resist,\" says Haymitch. He takes the \\nbottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As \\nthe door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark. \\nThere are still a few lights inside, but outside it\\'s as if \\nnight has fallen again. I realize we must be in the \\ntunnel that runs up through the mountains into the \\nCapitol. The mountains form a natural barrier \\nbetween the Capitol and the eastern districts. It is \\nalmost impossible to enter from the east except \\nthrough the tunnels. This geographical advantage was \\na major factor in the districts losing the war that led \\nto my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to \\nscale the mountains, they were easy targets for the \\nCapitol\\'s air forces. \\n\\nPeeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train \\nspeeds along. The tunnel goes on and on and I think \\nof the tons of rock separating me from the sky, and \\nmy chest tightens. I hate being encased in stone this \\nway. It reminds me of the mines and my father, \\ntrapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried forever in \\nthe darkness. \\n\\nThe train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright \\nlight floods the compartment. We can\\'t help it. Both \\nPeeta and I run to the window to see what we\\'ve only \\nseen on television, the Capitol, the ruling city of \\nPanem. The cameras haven\\'t lied about its grandeur. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nIf anything, they have not quite captured the \\nmagnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow \\nof hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll \\ndown the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people \\nwith bizarre hair and painted faces who have never \\nmissed a meal. All the colors seem artificial, the pinks \\ntoo deep, the greens too bright, the yellows painful to \\nthe eyes, like the flat round disks of hard candy we \\ncan never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in \\nDistrict 12. \\n\\nThe people begin to point at us eagerly as they \\nrecognize a tribute train rolling into the city. I step \\naway from the window, sickened by their excitement, \\nknowing they can\\'t wait to watch us die. But Peeta \\nholds his ground, actually waving and smiling at the \\ngawking crowd. He only stops when the train pulls \\ninto the station, blocking us from their view. \\n\\nHe sees me staring at him and shrugs. \"Who knows?\" \\nhe says. \"One of them may be rich.\" \\n\\nI have misjudged him. I think of his actions since the \\nreaping began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His \\nfather showing up with the cookies and promising to \\nfeed Prim . . . did Peeta put him up to that? His tears \\nat the station. Volunteering to wash Haymitch but \\nthen challenging him this morning when apparently \\nthe nice-guy approach had failed. And now the \\nwaving at the window, already trying to win the \\ncrowd. \\n\\nAll of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense \\nhe has a plan forming. He hasn\\'t accepted his death. \\nHe is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also \\nmeans that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me \\nthe bread, is fighting hard to kill me. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nR-i-i-i-p! I grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua \\nhair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a \\nstrip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair \\nbeneath it. \"Sorry!\" she pipes in her silly Capitol \\naccent. \"You\\'re just so hairy!\" \\n\\nWhy do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why \\ndo their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the \\nends of their sentences go up as if they\\'re asking a \\nquestion? Odd vowels, clipped words, and always a \\nhiss on the letter s ... no wonder it\\'s impossible not to \\nmimic them. \\n\\nVenia makes what\\'s supposed to be a sympathetic \\nface. \"Good news, though. This is the last one. \\nReady?\"Iget a grip on the edges of the table I\\'m seated \\non and nod. The final swathe of my leg hair is \\nuprooted in a painful jerk. \\n\\nI\\'ve been in the Remake Center for more than three \\nhours and I still haven\\'t met my stylist. Apparently he \\nhas no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other \\nmembers of my prep team have addressed some \\nobvious problems. This has included scrubbing down \\nmy body with a gritty loam that has removed not only \\ndirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails \\ninto uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body \\nof hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of \\nmy eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff, leaving \\nme like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. I don\\'t like \\nit. My skin feels sore and tingling and intensely \\nvulnerable. But I have kept my side of the bargain \\nwith Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re doing very well,\" says some guy named \\nFlavius. He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake \\nand applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his \\nmouth. \"If there\\'s one thing we can\\'t stand, it\\'s a \\nwhiner. Grease her down!\" \\n\\nVenia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire \\nbody has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me \\ndown with a lotion that first stings but then soothes \\nmy raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, \\nremoving the thin robe I\\'ve been allowed to wear off \\nand on. I stand there, completely naked, as the three \\ncircle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of \\nhair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they\\'re so \\nunlike people that I\\'m no more self-conscious than if \\na trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my \\nfeet. \\n\\nThe three step back and admire their work. \\n\"Excellent! You almost look like a human being now!\" \\nsays Flavius, and they all laugh. \\n\\nI force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I \\nam. \"Thank you,\" I say sweetly. \"We don\\'t have much \\ncause to look nice in District Twelve.\" \\n\\nThis wins them over completely. \"Of course, you \\ndon\\'t, you poor darling!\" says Octavia clasping her \\nhands together in distress for me. \\n\\n\"But don\\'t worry,\" says Venia. \"By the time Cinna is \\nthrough with you, you\\'re going to be absolutely \\ngorgeous!\" \\n\\n\"We promise! You know, now that we\\'ve gotten rid of \\nall the hair and filth, you\\'re not horrible at all!\" says \\nFlavius encouragingly. \"Let\\'s call Cinna!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThey dart out of the room. It\\'s hard to hate my prep \\nteam. They\\'re such total idiots. And yet, in an odd \\nway, I know they\\'re sincerely trying to help me. \\n\\nI look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the \\nimpulse to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my \\nstylist, will surely make me remove it at once. Instead \\nmy hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body \\nmy prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers \\nstroke the silky braids my mother so carefully \\narranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and shoes \\non the floor of my train car, never thinking about \\nretrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, \\nof home. Now I wish I had. \\n\\nThe door opens and a young man who must be Cinna \\nenters. I\\'m taken aback by how normal he looks. Most \\nof the stylists they interview on television are so dyed, \\nstenciled, and surgically altered they\\'re grotesque. \\nBut Cinna\\'s close-cropped hair appears to be its \\nnatural shade of brown. He\\'s in a simple black shirt \\nand pants. The only concession to self-alteration \\nseems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been \\napplied with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of \\ngold in his green eyes. And, despite my disgust with \\nthe Capitol and their hideous fashions, I can\\'t help \\nthinking how attractive it looks. \\n\\n\"Hello, Katniss. I\\'m Cinna, your stylist,\" he says in a \\nquiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitol\\'s \\naffectations. \\n\\n\"Hello,\" I venture cautiously. \\n\\n\"Just give me a moment, all right?\" he asks. He walks \\naround my naked body, not touching me, but taking \\nin every inch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to \\ncross my arms over my chest. \"Who did your hair?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"My mother,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect \\nbalance with your profile. She has very clever fingers,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\nI had expected someone flamboyant, someone older \\ntrying desperately to look young, someone who viewed \\nme as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter. \\nCinna has met none of these expectations. \\n\\n\"You\\'re new, aren\\'t you? I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen you \\nbefore,\" I say. Most of the stylists are familiar, \\nconstants in the ever-changing pool of tributes. Some \\nhave been around my whole life. \\n\\n\"Yes, this is my first year in the Games,\" says Cinna. \\n\\n\"So they gave you District Twelve,\" I say. Newcomers \\ngenerally end up with us, the least desirable district. \\n\\n\"I asked for District Twelve,\" he says without further \\nexplanation. \"Why don\\'t you put on your robe and \\nwell have a chat.\" \\n\\nPulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a \\nsitting room. Two red couches face off over a low \\ntable. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely \\nglass, providing a window to the city. I can see by the \\nlight that it must be around noon, although the \\nsunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to \\nsit on one of the couches and takes his place across \\nfrom me. He presses a button on the side of the table. \\nThe top splits and from below rises a second tabletop \\nthat holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges \\ncooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly \\nwhite grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped \\nlike flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of \\nhoney. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI try to imagine assembling this meal myself back \\nhome. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make \\ndo with a wild turkey. I\\'d need to shoot a second \\nturkey to trade for an orange. Goat\\'s milk would have \\nto substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the \\ngarden. I\\'d have to get wild onions from the woods. I \\ndon\\'t recognize the grain, our own tessera ration \\ncooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy \\nrolls would mean another trade with the baker, \\nperhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, \\nI can\\'t even guess what\\'s in it. Days of hunting and \\ngathering for this one meal and even then it would be \\na poor substitution for the Capitol version. \\n\\nWhat must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world \\nwhere food appears at the press of a button? How \\nwould I spend the hours I now commit to combing the \\nwoods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? \\nWhat do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, \\nbesides decorating their bodies and waiting around \\nfor a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for \\ntheir entertainment? \\n\\nI look up and find Cinna\\'s eyes trained on mine. \"How \\ndespicable we must seem to you,\" he says. \\n\\nHas he seen this in my face or somehow read my \\nthoughts? He\\'s right, though. The whole rotten lot of \\nthem is despicable. \\n\\n\"No matter,\" says Cinna. \"So, Katniss, about your \\ncostume for the opening ceremonies. My partner, \\nPortia, is the stylist for your fellow tribute, Peeta. And \\nour current thought is to dress you in complementary \\ncostumes,\" says Cinna. \"As you know, it\\'s customary \\nto reflect the flavor of the district.\" \\n\\nFor the opening ceremonies, you\\'re supposed to wear \\n\\nsomething that suggests your district\\'s principal \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nindustry. District 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. \\nDistrict 3, factories. This means that coming from \\nDistrict 12, Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal \\nminer\\'s getup. Since the baggy miner\\'s jumpsuits are \\nnot particularly becoming, our tributes usually end \\nup in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One \\nyear, our tributes were stark naked and covered in \\nblack powder to represent coal dust. It\\'s always \\ndreadful and does nothing to win favor with the \\ncrowd. I prepare myself for the worst. \\n\\n\"So, I\\'ll be in a coal miner outfit?\" I ask, hoping it \\nwon\\'t be indecent. \\n\\n\"Not exactly. You see, Portia and I think that coal \\nminer thing\\'s very overdone. No one will remember \\nyou in that. And we both see it as our job to make the \\nDistrict Twelve tributes unforgettable,\" says Cinna. \\n\\nI\\'ll be naked for sure, I think. \\n\\n\"So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, we\\'re \\ngoing to focus on the coal,\" says Cinna. Naked and \\ncovered in black dust, I think. \"And what do we do \\nwith coal? We burn it,\" says Cinna. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss?\" He sees \\nmy expression and grins. \\n\\nA few hours later, I am dressed in what will either be \\nthe most sensational or the deadliest costume in the \\nopening ceremonies. I\\'m in a simple black unitard \\nthat covers me from ankle to neck. Shiny leather \\nboots lace up to my knees. But it\\'s the fluttering cape \\nmade of streams of orange, yellow, and red and the \\nmatching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna \\nplans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls \\ninto the streets. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic \\nfire Portia and I came up with. Youll be perfectly \\nsafe,\" he says. But I\\'m not convinced I won\\'t be \\nperfectly barbecued by the time we reach the city\\'s \\ncenter. \\n\\nMy face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of \\nhighlighting here and there. My hair has been \\nbrushed out and then braided down my back in my \\nusual style. \"I want the audience to recognize you \\nwhen you\\'re in the arena,\" says Cinna \\ndreamily. \"Katniss, the girl who was on fire.\" \\n\\nIt crosses my mind that Cinna\\'s calm and normal \\ndemeanor masks a complete madman. \\n\\nDespite this morning\\'s revelation about Peeta\\'s \\ncharacter, I\\'m actually relieved when he shows up, \\ndressed in an identical costume. He should know \\nabout fire, being a baker\\'s son and all. His stylist, \\nPortia, and her team accompany him in, and everyone \\nis absolutely giddy with excitement over what a \\nsplash well make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit \\nweary as he accepts congratulations. \\n\\nWe\\'re whisked down to the bottom level of the \\nRemake Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. \\nThe opening ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of \\ntributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by \\nteams of four horses. Ours are coal black. The \\nanimals are so well trained, no one even needs to \\nguide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the \\nchariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the \\ndrape of our capes, before moving off to consult with \\neach other. \\n\\n\"What do you think?\" I whisper to Peeta. \"About the \\nfire?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll rip off your cape if you 11 rip off mine,\" he says \\nthrough gritted teeth. \\n\\n\"Deal,\" I say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon \\nenough, well avoid the worst burns. It\\'s bad though. \\nThey\\'ll throw us into the arena no matter what \\ncondition we\\'re in. \"I know we promised Haymitch \\nwe\\'d do exactly what they said, but I don\\'t think he \\nconsidered this angle.\" \\n\\n\"Where is Haymitch, anyway? Isn\\'t he supposed to \\nprotect us from this sort of thing?\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"With all that alcohol in him, it\\'s probably not \\nadvisable to have him around an open flame,\" I say. \\n\\nAnd suddenly we\\'re both laughing. I guess we\\'re both \\nso nervous about the Games and more pressingly, \\npetrified of being turned into human torches, we\\'re \\nnot acting sensibly. \\n\\nThe opening music begins. It\\'s easy to hear, blasted \\naround the Capitol. Massive doors slide open \\nrevealing the crowd-lined streets. The ride lasts about \\ntwenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle, where \\nthey will welcome us, play the anthem, and escort us \\ninto the Training Center, which will be our \\nhome/ prison until the Games begin. \\n\\nThe tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot \\npulled by snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, \\nspray-painted silver, in tasteful tunics glittering with \\njewels. District 1 makes luxury items for the Capitol. \\nYou can hear the roarofthe crowd. They are always \\nfavorites. \\n\\nDistrict 2 gets into position to follow them. In no time \\nat all, we are approaching the door and I can see that \\nbetween the overcast sky and evening hour the light \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nis turning gray. The tributes from District 1 1 are just \\nrolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. \\n\"Here we go then,\" he says, and before we can react \\nhe sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for the heat, \\nbut there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna \\nclimbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He \\nlets out a sign of relief. \"It works.\" Then he gently \\ntucks a hand under my chin. \"Remember, heads high. \\nSmiles. They\\'re going to love you!\" \\n\\nCinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He \\nshouts something up at us, but the music drowns \\nhim out. He shouts again and gestures. \\n\\n\"What\\'s he saying?\" I ask Peeta. For the first time, I \\nlook at him and realize that ablaze with the fake \\nflames, he is dazzling. And I must be, too. \\n\\n\"I think he said for us to hold hands,\" says Peeta. He \\ngrabs my right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna \\nfor confirmation. He nods and gives a thumbs-up, \\nand that\\'s the last thing I see before we enter the city. \\n\\nThe crowd\\'s initial alarm at our appearance quickly \\nchanges to cheers and shouts of \"District Twelve!\" \\nEvery head is turned our way, pulling the focus from \\nthe three chariots ahead of us. At first, I\\'m frozen, but \\nthen I catch sight of us on a large television screen \\nand am floored by how breathtaking we look. In the \\ndeepening twilight, the firelight illuminates our faces. \\nWe seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing \\ncapes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, \\nwe both look more attractive but utterly recognizable. \\n\\nRemember, heads high. Smiles. They\\'re going to love \\nyou! I hear Cinna\\'s voice in my head. I lift my chin a \\nbit higher, put on my most winning smile, and wave \\nwith my free hand. I\\'m glad now I have Peeta to clutch \\nfor balance, he is so steady, solid as a rock. As I gain \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nconfidence, I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd. \\nThe people of the Capitol are going nuts, showering \\nus with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, \\nwhich they have bothered to find on the program. \\n\\nThe pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work \\ntheir way into my blood, and I can\\'t suppress my \\nexcitement. Cinna has given me a great advantage. No \\none will forget me. Not my look, not my name. \\nKatniss. The girl who was on fire. \\n\\nFor the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in \\nme. Surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take \\nme on! And with a little extra help, some food, the \\nright weapon, why should I count myself out of the \\nGames? \\n\\nSomeone throws me a red rose. I catch it, give it a \\ndelicate sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general \\ndirection of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to \\ncatch my kiss, as if it were a real and tangible thing. \\n\\n\"Katniss! Katniss!\" I can hear my name being called \\nfrom all sides. Everyone wants my kisses. \\n\\nIt\\'s not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I \\nmust have completely stopped the circulation in \\nPeeta\\'s hand. That\\'s how tightly I\\'ve been holding it. I \\nlook down at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp, \\nbut he regains his grip on me. \"No, don\\'t let go of me,\" \\nhe says. The firelight flickers off his blue eyes. \\n\"Please. I might fall out of this thing.\" \\n\\n\"Okay,\" I say. So I keep holding on, but I can\\'t help \\nfeeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us \\ntogether. It\\'s not really fair to present us as a team \\nand then lock us into the arena to kill each other. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On \\nthe buildings that surround the Circle, every window \\nis packed with the most prestigious citizens of the \\nCapitol. Our horses pull our chariot right up to \\nPresident Snow\\'s mansion, and we come to a halt. \\nThe music ends with a flourish. \\n\\nThe president, a small, thin man with paper-white \\nhair, gives the official welcome from a balcony above \\nus. It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the \\ntributes during the speech. But I can see on the \\nscreen that we are getting way more than our share of \\nairtime. The darker it becomes, the more difficult it is \\nto take your eyes off our flickering. When the national \\nanthem plays, they do make an effort to do a quick \\ncut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera \\nholds on the District 12 chariot as it parades around \\nthe circle one final time and disappears into the \\nTraining Center. \\n\\nThe doors have only just shut behind us when we\\'re \\nengulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly \\nunintelligible as they babble out praise. As I glance \\naround, I notice a lot of the other tributes are \\nshooting us dirty looks, which confirms what I\\'ve \\nsuspected, we\\'ve literally outshone them all. Then \\nCinna and Portia are there, helping us down from the \\nchariot, carefully removing our flaming capes and \\nheaddresses. Portia extinguishes them with some \\nkind of spray from a canister. \\n\\nI realize I\\'m still glued to Peeta and force my stiff \\nfingers to open. We both massage our hands. \\n\\n\"Thanks for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little \\nshaky there,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"It didn\\'t show,\" I tell him. \"I\\'m sure no one noticed.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure they didn\\'t notice anything but you. You \\nshould wear flames more often,\" he says. \"They suit \\nyou.\" And then he gives me a smile that seems so \\ngenuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness \\nthat unexpected warmth rushes through me. \\n\\nA warning bell goes off in my head. Don\\'t be so \\nstupid. Peeta is planning how to kill you, I remind \\nmyself. He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The \\nmore likable he is, the more deadly he is. \\n\\nBut because two can play at this game, I stand on \\ntiptoe and kiss his cheek. Right on his bruise. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Training Center has a tower designed exclusively \\nfor the tributes and their teams. This will be our \\nhome until the actual Games begin. Each district has \\nan entire floor. You simply step onto an elevator and \\npress the number of your district. Easy enough to \\nremember. \\n\\nI\\'ve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the \\nJustice Building back in District 12. Once to receive \\nthe medal for my father\\'s death and then yesterday to \\nsay my final goodbyes to my friends and family. But \\nthat\\'s a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail \\nand smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are \\nmade of crystal so that you can watch the people on \\nthe ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into \\nthe air. It\\'s exhilarating and I\\'m tempted to ask Effie \\nTrinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that \\nseems childish. \\n\\nApparently, Effie Trinket\\'s duties did not conclude at \\nthe station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us \\nright into the arena. In a way, that\\'s a plus because at \\nleast she can be counted on to corral us around to \\nplaces on time whereas we haven\\'t seen Haymitch \\nsince he agreed to help us on the train. Probably \\npassed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other \\nhand, seems to be flying high. We\\'re the first team \\nshe\\'s ever chaperoned that made a splash at the \\nopening ceremonies. She\\'s complimentary about not \\njust our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. \\nAnd, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone who\\'s \\nanyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all \\nday, trying to win us sponsors. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been very mysterious, though,\" she says, her \\neyes squint half shut. \"Because, of course, Haymitch \\nhasn\\'t bothered to tell me your strategies. But I\\'ve \\ndone my best with what I had to work with. How \\nKatniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How you\\'ve \\nboth successfully struggled to overcome the \\nbarbarism of your district.\" \\n\\nBarbarism? That\\'s ironic coming from a woman \\nhelping to prepare us for slaughter. And what\\'s she \\nbasing our success on? Our table manners? \\n\\n\"Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being \\nfrom the coal district. But I said, and this was very \\nclever of me, I said, Well, if you put enough pressure \\non coal it turns to pearls!\\'\" Effie beams at us so \\nbrilliantly that we have no choice but to respond \\nenthusiastically to her cleverness even though it\\'s \\nwrong. \\n\\nCoal doesn\\'t turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. \\nPossibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but that\\'s \\nuntrue, too. I\\'ve heard they have some sort of \\nmachine in District 1 that can turn graphite into \\ndiamonds. But we don\\'t mine graphite in District 12. \\nThat was part of District 13\\'s job until they were \\ndestroyed. \\n\\nI wonder if the people she\\'s been plugging us to all \\nday either know or care. \\n\\n\"Unfortunately, I can\\'t seal the sponsor deals for you. \\nOnly Haymitch can do that,\" says Effie grimly. \"But \\ndon\\'t worry, 111 get him to the table at gunpoint if \\nnecessary.\" \\n\\nAlthough lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket \\nhas a certain determination I have to admire. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMy quarters are larger than our entire house back \\nhome. They are plush, like the train car, but also \\nhave so many automatic gadgets that I\\'m sure I won\\'t \\nhave time to press all the buttons. The shower alone \\nhas a panel with more than a hundred options you \\ncan choose regulating water temperature, pressure, \\nsoaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging \\nsponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come \\non that blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with \\nthe knots in my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a \\nbox that sends a current through my scalp, \\nuntangling, parting, and drying my hair almost \\ninstantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a \\nglossy curtain. \\n\\nI program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The \\nwindows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my \\ncommand. You need only whisper a type of food from \\na gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears, \\nhot and steamy, before you in less than a minute. I \\nwalk around the room eating goose liver and puffy \\nbread until there\\'s a knock on the door. Effie\\'s calling \\nme to dinner. \\n\\nGood. I\\'m starving. \\n\\nPeeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a \\nbalcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the \\ndining room. I\\'m glad to see the stylists, particularly \\nafter I hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal \\npresided over by just \\n\\nEffie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, \\ndinner isn\\'t really about food, it\\'s about planning out \\nour strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already \\nproven how valuable they are. \\n\\nA silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us \\nall stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ndown, but I\\'ve never had wine, except the homemade \\nstuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will I get \\na chance to try it again? I take a sip of the tart, dry \\nliquid and secretly think it could be improved by a \\nfew spoonfuls of honey. \\n\\nHaymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It \\nlooks as if he\\'s had his own stylist because he\\'s clean \\nand groomed and about as sober as I\\'ve ever seen \\nhim. He doesn\\'t refuse the offer of wine, but when he \\nstarts in on his soup, I realize it\\'s the first time I\\'ve \\never seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull himself \\ntogether long enough to help us. \\n\\nCinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on \\nHaymitch and Effie. At least they\\'re addressing each \\nother decently. And they both have nothing but praise \\nfor our stylists \\'opening act. While they make small \\ntalk, I concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, \\nbitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast \\nbeef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, \\ncheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet \\nblue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in \\nwhite tunics like the one who gave us wine, move \\nwordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters \\nand glasses full. \\n\\nAbout halfway through my glass of wine, my head \\nstarts feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I \\ndon\\'t like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How \\nHaymitch can stand walking around like this full-time \\nis a mystery. \\n\\nI try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our \\ninterview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous- \\nlooking cake on the table and deftly lights it. It blazes \\nup and then the flames flicker around the edges \\nawhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment of \\ndoubt. \"What makes it burn? Is it alcohol?\" I say, \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nlooking up at the girl. \"That\\'s the last thing I wa \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\noh! I know you!\" \\n\\nI can\\'t place a name or time to the girl\\'s face. But I\\'m \\ncertain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, \\nthe porcelain white skin. But even as I utter the \\nwords, I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and \\nguilt at the sight of her, and while I can\\'t pull it up, I \\nknow some bad memory is associated with her. The \\nexpression of terror that crosses her face only adds to \\nmy confusion and unease. She shakes her head in \\ndenial quickly and hurries away from the table. \\n\\nWhen I look back, the four adults are watching me \\nlike hawks. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly \\nknow an Avox?\" snaps Effie. \"The very thought.\" \\n\\n\"What\\'s an Avox?\" I ask stupidly. \\n\\n\"Someone who committed a crime. They cut her \\ntongue so she can\\'t speak,\" says Haymitch. \"She\\'s \\nprobably a traitor of some sort. Not likely you\\'d know \\nher.\" \\n\\n\"And even if you did, you\\'re not to speak to one of \\nthem unless it\\'s to give an order,\" says Effie. \"Of \\ncourse, you don\\'t really know her.\" \\n\\nBut I do know her. And now that Haymitch has \\nmentioned the word traitor I remember from where. \\nThe disapproval is so high I could never admit it. \"No, \\nI guess not, I just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" I stammer, and the wine is not \\nhelping. \\n\\nPeeta snaps his fingers. \"Delly Cartwright. That\\'s who \\nit is. I kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then \\nI realized she\\'s a dead ringer for Delly.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDelly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with \\nyellowish hair who looks about as much like our \\nserver as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be \\nthe friendliest person on the planet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she smiles \\nconstantly at everybody in school, even me. I have \\nnever seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump \\non Peeta\\'s suggestion gratefully. \"Of course, that\\'s \\nwho I was thinking of. It must be the hair,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Something about the eyes, too,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nThe energy at the table relaxes. \"Oh, well. If that\\'s all \\nit is,\" says Cinna. \"And yes, the cake has spirits, but \\nall the alcohol has burned off. I ordered it specially in \\nhonor of your fiery debut.\" \\n\\nWe eat the cake and move into a sitting room to \\nwatch the replay of the opening ceremonies that\\'s \\nbeing broadcast. A few of the other couples make a \\nnice impression, but none of them can hold a candle \\nto us. Even our own party lets out an \"Ahh!\" as they \\nshow us coming out of the Remake Center. \\n\\n\"Whose idea was the hand holding?\" asks Haymitch. \\n\\n\"Cinna\\'s,\" says Portia. \\n\\n\"Just the perfect touch of rebellion,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"Very nice.\" \\n\\nRebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. \\nBut when I remember the other couples, standing \\nstiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each \\nother, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the \\nGames had already begun, I know what Haymitch \\nmeans. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as \\nfriends has distinguished us as much as the fiery \\ncostumes. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet \\nme for breakfast and I\\'ll tell you exactly how I want \\nyou to play it, \"says Haymitch to Peeta and I. \"Now go \\nget some sleep while the grown-ups talk.\" \\n\\nPeeta and I walk together down the corridor to our \\nrooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the \\nframe, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting \\nI pay attention to him. \"So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine \\nfinding her lookalike here.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s asking for an explanation, and I\\'m tempted to \\ngive him one. We both know he covered for me. So \\nhere I am in his debt again. If I tell him the truth \\nabout the girl, somehow that might even things up. \\nHow can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, \\nit couldn\\'t do me much harm. It was just something I \\nwitnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly \\nCartwright. \\n\\nI realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. \\nSomeone who might be able to help me figure out her \\nstory. \\n\\nGale would be my first choice, but it\\'s unlikely I\\'ll ever \\nsee Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give \\nhim any possible advantage over me, but I don\\'t see \\nhow. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make \\nhim believe I see him as a friend. \\n\\nBesides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue \\nfrightens me. She has reminded me why I\\'m here. Not \\nto model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to \\ndie a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer. \\n\\nTo tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the \\nwine. I stare down the empty corridor as if the \\ndecision lies there. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta picks up on my hesitation. \"Have you been on \\nthe roof yet?\" I shake my head. \"Cinna showed me. \\nYou can practically see the whole city. The wind\\'s a \\nbit loud, though.\" \\n\\nI translate this into \"No one will overhear us \\ntalking\"in my head. You do have the sense that we \\nmight be under surveillance here. \"Can we just go \\nup?\" \\n\\n\"Sure, come on,\" says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of \\nstairs that lead to the roof. There\\'s a small dome- \\nshaped room with a door to the outside. As we step \\ninto the cool, windy evening air, I catch my breath at \\nthe view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of \\nfireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, \\nusually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the \\nevenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you \\ncan count on it is when they\\'re airing the Games or \\nsome important government message on television \\nthat it\\'s mandatory to watch. But here there would be \\nno shortage. Ever. \\n\\nPeeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I \\nlook straight down the side of the building to the \\nstreet, which is buzzing with people. You can hear \\ntheir cars, an occasional shout, and a strange \\nmetallic tinkling. In District 12, we\\'d all be thinking \\nabout bed right now. \\n\\n\"I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren\\'t they \\nworried that some of the tributes might decide to \\njump right over the side?\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"What\\'d he say?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"You can\\'t,\" says Peeta. He holds out his hand into \\nseemingly empty space. There\\'s a sharp zap and he \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\njerks it back. \"Some kind of electric field throws you \\nback on the roof.\" \\n\\n\"Always worried about our safety,\" I say. Even though \\nCinna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we\\'re \\nsupposed to be up here now, so late and alone. I\\'ve \\nnever seen tributes on the Training Center roof \\nbefore. But that doesn\\'t mean we\\'re not being taped. \\n\"Do you think they\\'re watching us now?\" \\n\\n\"Maybe,\" he admits. \"Come see the garden.\" \\n\\nOn the other side of the dome, they\\'ve built a garden \\nwith flower beds and potted trees. From the branches \\nhang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the \\ntinkling I heard. Here in the garden, on this windy \\nnight, it\\'s enough to drown out two people who are \\ntrying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly. \\n\\nI pretend to examine a blossom. \"We were hunting in \\nthe woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,\" I \\nwhisper. \\n\\n\"You and your father?\" he whispers back. \\n\\n\"No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped \\nsinging at once. Except one. As if it were giving a \\nwarning call. And then we saw her. I\\'m sure it was \\nthe same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were \\ntattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from \\nno sleep. They were running as if their lives depended \\non it,\" I say. \\n\\nFor a moment I\\'m silent, as I remember how the sight \\nof this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, \\nfleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we \\nwondered if we could have helped them escape. \\nPerhaps we might have. Concealed them. If we\\'d \\nmoved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise, \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nyes, but we\\'re both hunters. We know how animals \\nlook at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon \\nas we saw them. But we only watched. \\n\\n\"The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,\" I continue \\nto Peeta. \"I mean, one moment the sky was empty and \\nthe next it was there. It didn\\'t make a sound, but they \\nsaw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her \\nup, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort \\nof spear through the boy. It was attached to a cable \\nand they hauled him up as well. But I\\'m certain he \\nwas dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boy\\'s \\nname, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. \\nVanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing \\nagain, as if nothing had happened.\" \\n\\n\"Did they see you?\" Peeta asked. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. We were under a shelf of rock,\" I reply. \\n\\nBut I do know. There was a moment, after the \\nbirdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had \\nseen us. She\\'d locked eyes with me and called out for \\nhelp. But neither Gale or I had responded. \\n\\n\"You\\'re shivering,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nThe wind and the story have blown all the warmth \\nfrom my body. The girl\\'s scream. Had it been her last? \\n\\nPeeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my \\nshoulders. I start to take a step back, but then I let \\nhim, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket \\nand his kindness. A friend would do that, right? \\n\\n\"They were from here?\" he asks, and he secures a \\nbutton at my neck. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI nod. They\\'d had that Capitol look about them. The \\nboy and the girl. \\n\\n\"Where do you suppose they were going?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that,\" I say. District 12 is pretty much \\nthe end of the line. Beyond us, there\\'s only \\nwilderness. If you don\\'t count the ruins of District 13 \\nthat still smolder from the toxic bombs. They show it \\non television occasionally, just to remind us. \"Or why \\nthey would leave here.\" Haymitch had called the \\nAvoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the \\nCapitol. But they had everything here. No cause to \\nrebel. \\n\\n\"I\\'d leave here,\" Peeta blurts out. Then he looks \\naround nervously. It was loud enough to hear above \\nthe chimes. He laughs. \"I\\'d go home now if they let me. \\nBut you have to admit, the food\\'s prime.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s covered again. If that\\'s all you\\'d heard it would \\njust sound like the words of a scared tribute, not \\nsomeone contemplating the unquestionable goodness \\nof the Capitol. \\n\\n\"It\\'s getting chilly. We better go in,\" he says. Inside \\nthe dome, it\\'s warm and bright. His tone is \\nconversational. \"Your friend Gale. He\\'s the one who \\ntook your sister away at the reaping?\" \\n\\n\"Yes. Do you know him?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I \\nthought he was your cousin or something. You favor \\neach other,\" he says. \\n\\n\"No, we\\'re not related,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta nods, unreadable. \"Did he come to say good-bye \\nto you?\" \\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say, observing him carefully. \"So did your \\nfather. He brought me cookies.\" \\n\\nPeeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after \\nwatching him lie so smoothly, I don\\'t give this much \\nweight. \"Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I \\nthink he wishes he had a daughter instead of a \\nhouseful of boys.\" \\n\\nThe idea that I might ever have been discussed, \\naround the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in \\npassing in Peeta\\'s house gives me a start. It must \\nhave been when the mother was out of the room. \\n\\n\"He knew your mother when they were kids,\" says \\nPeeta. \\n\\nAnother surprise. But probably true. \"Oh, yes. She \\ngrew up in town,\" I say. It seems impolite to say she \\nnever mentioned the baker except to compliment his \\nbread. \\n\\nWe\\'re at my door. I give back his jacket. \"See you in \\nthe morning then.\" \\n\\n\"See you,\" he says, and walks off down the hall. \\n\\nWhen I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting \\nmy unitard and boots from where I left them on the \\nfloor before my shower. I want to apologize for \\npossibly getting her in trouble earlier. But I remember \\nI\\'m not supposed to speak to her unless I\\'m giving her \\nan order. \\n\\n\"Oh, sorry,\" I say. \"I was supposed to get those back \\nto Cinna. I\\'m sorry. Can you take them to him?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nShe avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out \\nthe door. \\n\\nI\\'d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I \\nknow that my apology runs much deeper. That I\\'m \\nashamed I never tried to help her in the woods. That I \\nlet the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without \\nlifting a finger. \\n\\nJust like I was watching the Games. \\n\\nI kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my \\nclothes. The shivering hasn\\'t stopped. Perhaps the girl \\ndoesn\\'t even remember me. But I know she does. You \\ndon\\'t forget the face of the person who was your last \\nhope. I pull the covers up over my head as if this will \\nprotect me from the redheaded girl who can\\'t speak. \\nBut I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through \\nwalls and doors and bedding. \\n\\nI wonder if shell enjoy watching me die. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\nMy slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The \\nface of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory \\nimages from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother \\nwithdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated \\nand terrified. I bolt up screaming for my father to run \\nas the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of \\nlight. \\n\\nDawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol \\nhas a misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must \\nhave bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My \\ntongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood. \\n\\nSlowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I \\narbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and \\nend up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of \\nicy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then I\\'m \\ndeluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with \\na heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is \\nflowing. \\n\\nWhen I\\'m dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an \\noutfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. \\nTight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and \\nleather shoes. I put my hair in the single braid down \\nmy back. This is the first time since the morning of \\nthe reaping that I resemble myself. No fancy hair and \\nclothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like I \\ncould be headed for the woods. It calms me. \\n\\nHaymitch didn\\'t give us an exact time to meet for \\nbreak-last and no one has contacted me this \\nmorning, but I\\'m hungry so I head down to the dining \\nroom, hoping there will be food. I\\'m not disappointed. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the table is empty, a long board off to the side \\nhas been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young \\nman, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. \\nWhen I ask if I can serve myself, he nods assent. I \\nload a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered \\nin thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon. \\nAs I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise over the \\nCapitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered \\nin beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at \\nthe table, breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot \\nchocolate, the way Peeta did on the train. \\n\\nMy mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must \\nbe up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. \\nPrim milking her goat before school. Just two \\nmornings ago, I was home. Can that be right? Yes, \\njust two. And now how empty the house feels, even \\nfrom a distance. What did they say last night about \\nmy fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, \\nor simply add to their terror when they saw the reality \\nof twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only \\none could live? \\n\\nHaymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, \\nfill their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is \\nwearing exactly the same outfit I am. I need to say \\nsomething to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow \\nup in out faces once the Games begin. Surely, they \\nmust know this. Then I remember Haymitch telling \\nme to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it \\nwas anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore \\nhim. But after last night\\'s triumph, I don\\'t have a lot \\nof room to criticize his choices. \\n\\nI\\'m nervous about the training. There will be three \\ndays in which all the tributes practice together. On \\nthe last afternoon, we\\'ll each get a chance to perform \\nin private before the Gamemakers. The thought of \\nmeeting the other tributes face-to-face makes me \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nqueasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from the \\nbasket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is \\ngone. \\n\\nWhen Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, \\nhe pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask \\nfrom his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans \\nhis elbows on the table. \"So, let\\'s get down to \\nbusiness. Training. First off, if you like, 111 coach you \\nseparately. Decide now.\" \\n\\n\"Why would you coach us separately?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the \\nother to know about,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nI exchange a look with Peeta. \"I don\\'t have any secret \\nskills,\" he says. \"And I already know what yours is, \\nright? I mean, I\\'ve eaten enough of your squirrels.\" \\n\\nI never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I \\nshot. Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly \\ngoing off and frying them up for himself. Not out of \\ngreed. But because town families usually eat \\nexpensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse. \\n\\n\"You can coach us together,\" I tell Haymitch. Peeta \\nnods. \\n\\n\"All right, so give me some idea of what you can \\ndo, \"says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"I can\\'t do anything,\" says Peeta. \"Unless you count \\nbaking bread.\" \\n\\n\"Sorry, I don\\'t. Katniss. I already know you\\'re handy \\nwith a knife,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not really. But I can hunt,\" I say. \"With a bow and \\narrow.\" \\n\\n\"And you\\'re good?\" asks Haymitch. \\n\\nI have to think about it. I\\'ve been putting food on the \\ntable for four years. That\\'s no small task. I\\'m not as \\ngood as my father was, but he\\'d had more practice. \\nI\\'ve better aim than Gale, but I\\'ve had more practice. \\nHe\\'s a genius with traps and snares. \"I\\'m all right,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"She\\'s excellent,\" says Peeta. \"My father buys her \\nsquirrels. He always comments on how the arrows \\nnever pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. \\nIt\\'s the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. \\nShe can even bring down deer.\" \\n\\nThis assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me \\ntotally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. \\nSecond, that he\\'s talking me up. \"What are you \\ndoing?\" I ask him suspiciously. \\n\\n\"What are you doing? If he\\'s going to help you, he has \\nto know what you\\'re capable of. Don\\'t underrate \\nyourself,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI don\\'t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. \\n\"What about you? I\\'ve seen you in the market. You \\ncan lift hundred-pound bags of flour,\" I snap at him. \\n\"Tell him that. That\\'s not nothing.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, and I\\'m sure the arena will be full of bags of \\nflour for me to chuck at people. It\\'s not like being able \\nto use a weapon. You know it isn\\'t,\" he shoots back. \\n\\n\"He can wrestle,\" I tell Haymitch. \"He came in second \\nin our school competition last year, only after his \\nbrother.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"What use is that? How many times have you seen \\nsomeone wrestle someone to death?\" says Peeta in \\ndisgust. \\n\\n\"There\\'s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is \\nto come up with a knife, and youll at least stand a \\nchance. If I get jumped, I\\'m dead!\" I can hear my voice \\nrising in anger. \\n\\n\"But you won\\'t! Youll be living up in some tree eating \\nraw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You \\nknow what my mother said to me when she came to \\nsay good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe \\nDistrict Twelve will finally have a winner. Then I \\nrealized, she didn\\'t mean me, she meant you!\" bursts \\nout Peeta. \\n\\n\"Oh, she meant you,\" I say with a wave of dismissal. \\n\\n\"She said, \\'She\\'s a survivor, that one.\\'Sheis,\" says \\nPeeta. \\n\\nThat pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that \\nabout me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the \\npain in Peeta\\'s eyes and know he isn\\'t lying. \\n\\nSuddenly I\\'m behind the bakery and I can feel the \\nchill of the rain running down my back, the \\nhollowness in my belly. I sound eleven years old when \\nI speak. \"But only because someone helped me.\" \\n\\nPeeta\\'s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and \\nI know he remembers that day, too. But he just \\nshrugs. \"People will help you in the arena. They 11 be \\ntripping over each other to sponsor you.\" \\n\\n\"No more than you,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. \"She has no idea. \\nThe effect she can have.\" He runs his fingernail along \\nthe wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me. \\n\\nWhat on earth does he mean? People help me? When \\nwe were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one \\nexcept Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, \\nthings changed. I\\'m a tough trader. Or am I? What \\neffect do I have? That I\\'m weak and needy? Is he \\nsuggesting that I got good deals because people pitied \\nme? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the \\nmerchants were a little generous in their trades, but I \\nalways attributed that to their long-standing \\nrelationship with my father. Besides, my game is first- \\nclass. No one pitied me! \\n\\nI glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. \\n\\nAfter about a minute of this, Haymitch says, \"Well, \\nthen. Well, well, well. Katniss, there\\'s no guarantee \\nthey\\'ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during \\nyour private session with the Gamemakers, show \\nthem what you can do. Until then, stay clear of \\narchery. Are you any good at trapping?\" \\n\\n\"I know a few basic snares,\" I mutter. \\n\\n\"That may be significant in terms of food,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"And Peeta, she\\'s right, never \\nunderestimate strength in the arena. Very often, \\nphysical power tilts the advantage to a player. In the \\nTraining Center, they will have weights, but don\\'t \\nreveal how much you can lift in front of the other \\ntributes. The plan\\'s the same for both of you. You go \\nto group training. Spend the time trying to learn \\nsomething you don\\'t know. Throw a spear. Swing a \\nmace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what \\nyou\\'re best at until your private sessions. Are we \\nclear?\" says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"One last thing. In public, I want you by each other\\'s \\nside every minute,\" says Haymitch. We both start to \\nobject, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. \\n\"Every minute! It\\'s not open for discussion! You \\nagreed to do as I said! You will be together, you will \\nappear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie \\nat the elevator at ten for training.\" \\n\\nI bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure \\nPeeta can hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating \\nHaymitch, hating Peeta, hating myself for mentioning \\nthat day long ago in the rain. \\n\\nIt\\'s such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to \\nbe friends! Talking up each other\\'s strengths, \\ninsisting the other take credit for their abilities. \\nBecause, in fact, at some point, we\\'re going to have to \\nknock it off and accept we\\'re bitter adversaries. Which \\nI\\'d be prepared to do right now if it wasn\\'t for \\nHaymitch\\'s stupid instruction that we stick together \\nin training. It\\'s my own fault, I guess, for telling him \\nhe didn\\'t have to coach us separately. But that didn\\'t \\nmean I wanted to do everything with Peeta. Who, by \\nthe way, clearly doesn\\'t want to be partnering up with \\nme, either. \\n\\nI hear Peeta\\'s voice in my head. She has no idea. The \\neffect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. \\nRight? but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a \\ncompliment. That he meant I was appealing in some \\nway. It\\'s weird, how much he\\'s noticed me. Like the \\nattention he\\'s paid to my hunting. And apparently, I \\nhave not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, \\neither. The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of \\nthe boy with the bread. \\n\\nIt\\'s almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my \\nhair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my \\nnervousness about meeting the other tributes, but \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nnow I can feel my anxiety rising again. By the time I \\nmeet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I catch myself \\nbiting my nails. I stop at once. \\n\\nThe actual training rooms are below ground level of \\nour building. With these elevators, the ride is less \\nthan a minute. The doors open into an enormous \\ngymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle \\ncourses. Although it\\'s not yet ten, we\\'re the last ones \\nto arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense \\ncircle. They each have a cloth square with their \\ndistrict number on it pinned to their shirts. While \\nsomeone pins the number 12 on my back, I do a quick \\nassessment. Peeta and I are the only two dressed \\nalike. \\n\\nAs soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, \\nathletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to \\nexplain the training schedule. Experts in each skill \\nwill remain at their stations. We will be free to travel \\nfrom area to area as we choose, per our mentor\\'s \\ninstructions. Some of the stations teach survival \\nskills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to \\nengage in any combative exercise with another \\ntribute. There are assistants on hand if we want to \\npractice with a partner. \\n\\nWhen Atala begins to read down the list of the skill \\nstations, my eyes can\\'t help flitting around to the \\nother tributes. It\\'s the first time we\\'ve been \\nassembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My \\nheart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of \\nthe girls are bigger than I am, even though many of \\nthe tributes have never been fed properly. You can see \\nit in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their \\neyes. I may be smaller naturally, but overall my \\nfamily\\'s resourcefulness has given me an edge in that \\narea. I stand straight, and while I\\'m thin, I\\'m strong. \\nThe meat and plants from the woods combined with \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthe exertion it took to get them have given me a \\nhealthier body than most of those I see around me. \\n\\nThe exceptions are the kids from the wealthier \\ndistricts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed \\nand trained throughout their lives for this moment. \\nThe tributes from 1,2, and 4 traditionally have this \\nlook about them. It\\'s technically against the rules to \\ntrain tributes before they reach the Capitol but it \\nhappens every year. In District 12, we call them the \\nCareer Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, \\nthe winner will be one of them. \\n\\nThe slight advantage I held coming into the Training \\nCenter, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish \\nin the presence of my competition. The other tributes \\nwere jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, \\nbecause our stylists were. Now I see nothing but \\ncontempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each \\nmust have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They \\nproject arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases \\nus, they head straight for the deadliest-looking \\nweapons in the gym and handle them with ease. \\n\\nI\\'m thinking that it\\'s lucky I\\'m a fast runner when \\nPeeta nudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside \\nme, per Haymitch\\'s instructions. His expression is \\nsober. \"Where would you like to start?\" \\n\\nI look around at the Career Tributes who are showing \\noff, clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the \\nothers, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having \\ntheir first lessons with a knife or an ax. \\n\\n\"Suppose we tie some knots,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Right you are,\" says Peeta. We cross to an empty \\nstation where the trainer seems pleased to have \\nstudents. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nis not the Hunger games hot spot. When he realizes I \\nknow something about snares, he shows us a simple, \\nexcellent trap that will leave a human competitor \\ndangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this \\none skill for an hour until both of us have mastered \\nit. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely \\nseems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of \\nmud and clay and berry juices around on his pale \\nskin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The \\ntrainer who runs the camouflage station is full of \\nenthusiasm at his work. \\n\\n\"I do the cakes,\" he admits to me. \\n\\n\"The cakes?\" I ask. I\\'ve been preoccupied with \\nwatching the boy from District 2 send a spear \\nthrough a dummy\\'s heart from fifteen yards. \"What \\ncakes?\" \\n\\n\"At home. The iced ones, for the bakery,\" he says. \\n\\nHe means the ones they display in the windows. \\nFancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in \\nfrosting. They\\'re for birthdays and New Year\\'s Day. \\nWhen we\\'re in the square, Prim always drags me over \\nto admire them, although we\\'d never be able to afford \\none. There\\'s little enough beauty in District 12, \\nthough, so I can hardly deny her this. \\n\\nI look more critically at the design on Peeta\\'s arm. The \\nalternating pattern of light and dark suggests \\nsunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. I \\nwonder how he knows this, since I doubt he\\'s ever \\nbeen beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this \\nup from just that scraggly old apple tree in his \\nbackyard? Somehow the whole thing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his skill, \\nthose inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage \\nexpert \\xe2\\x80\\x94 annoys me. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,\"I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be so superior. You can never tell what you 11 \\nfind in the arena. Say it\\'s actually a gigantic cake \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\nbegins Peeta. \\n\\n\"Say we move on,\" I break in. \\n\\nSo the next three days pass with Peeta and I going \\nquietly from station to station. We do pick up some \\nvaluable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, \\nto making shelter. Despite Haymitch\\'s order to appear \\nmediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I \\nsweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. \\nWe steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, \\nwanting to save those for our private sessions. \\n\\nThe Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. \\nTwenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple \\nrobes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround \\nthe gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch \\nus, jotting down notes, other times eating at the \\nendless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring \\nthe lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye \\non the District 12 tributes. Several times I\\'ve looked \\nup to find one fixated on me. They consult with the \\ntrainers during our meals as well. We see them all \\ngathered together when we come back. \\n\\nBreakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at \\nlunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off \\nthe gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the \\nroom and you serve yourself. The Career Tributes \\ntend to gather rowdily around one table, as if to prove \\ntheir superiority, that they have no fear of one \\nanother and consider the rest of us beneath notice. \\nMost of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No \\none says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nsince Haymitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep \\nup a friendly conversation during the meals. \\n\\nIt\\'s not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is \\npainful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, \\nPeeta empties our breadbasket and points out how \\nthey have been careful to include types from the \\ndistricts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. \\nThe fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from \\nDistrict 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds \\nfrom District 1 1 . Somehow, although it\\'s made from \\nthe same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the \\nugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home. \\n\\n\"And there you have it,\" says Peeta, scooping the \\nbreads back in the basket. \\n\\n\"You certainly know a lot,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Only about bread,\" he says. \"Okay, now laugh as if \\nI\\'ve said something funny.\" \\n\\nWe both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore \\nthe stares from around the room. \\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll keep smiling pleasantly and you \\ntalk,\"says Peeta. It\\'s wearing us both out, Haymitch \\'s \\ndirection to be friendly. Because ever since I slammed \\nmy door, there\\'s been a chill in the air between us. \\nBut we have our orders. \\n\\n\"Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a \\nbear?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"No, but it sounds fascinating,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true \\nstory, in which I\\'d foolishly challenged a black bear \\nover the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nquestions right on cue. He\\'s much better at this than \\nI am. \\n\\nOn the second day, while we\\'re taking a shot at spear \\nthrowing, he whispers to me. \"I think we have a \\nshadow.\" \\n\\nI throw my spear, which I\\'m not too bad at actually, if \\nI don\\'t have to throw too far, and see the little girl \\nfrom District 1 1 standing back a bit, watching us. \\nShe\\'s the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me \\nso of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. \\nShe has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown skin and \\nstands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly \\nextended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the \\nslightest sound. It\\'s impossible not to think of a bird. \\n\\nI pick up another spear while Peeta throws. \"I think \\nher name\\'s Rue,\" he says softly. \\n\\nI bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows \\nin the Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could \\ntip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet. \\n\\n\"What can we do about it?\" I ask him, more harshly \\nthan I intended. \\n\\n\"Nothing to do,\" he says back. \"Just making \\nconversation.\" \\n\\nNow that I know she\\'s there, it\\'s hard to ignore the \\nchild. She slips up and joins us at different stations. \\nLike me, she\\'s clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and \\nhas good aim. She can hit the target every time with a \\nslingshot. But what is a slingshot against a 220- \\npound male with a sword? \\n\\nBack on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill \\nus throughout breakfast and dinner about every \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nmoment of the day. What we did, who watched us, \\nhow the other tributes size up. Cinna and Portia \\naren\\'t around, so there\\'s no one to add any sanity to \\nthe meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting \\nanymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, \\ndetermined to whip us into shape. Full of endless \\ndirections about what we should do and not do in \\ntraining. Peeta is more patient, but I become fed up \\nand surly. \\n\\nWhen we finally escape to bed on the second night, \\nPeeta mumbles, \"Someone ought to get Haymitch a \\ndrink.\" \\n\\nI make a sound that is somewhere between a snort \\nand a laugh. Then catch myself. It\\'s messing with my \\nmind too much, trying to keep straight when we\\'re \\nsupposedly friends and when we\\'re not. At least when \\nwe get into the arena, 111 know where we stand. \\n\"Don\\'t. Don\\'t let\\'s pretend when there\\'s no one \\naround.\" \\n\\n\"All right, Katniss,\" he says tiredly. After that, we only \\ntalk in front of people. \\n\\nOn the third day of training, they start to call us out \\nof lunch for our private sessions with the \\nGamemakers. District by district, first the boy, then \\nthe girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is slated to go \\nlast. We linger in the dining room, unsure where else \\nto go. No one comes back once they have left. As the \\nroom empties, the pressure to appear friendly \\nlightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone. \\nWe sit in silence until they summon Peeta. He rises. \\n\\n\"Remember what Haymitch said about being sure to \\nthrow the weights.\" The words come out of my mouth \\nwithout permission. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thanks. I will,\" he says. \"You ... shoot straight.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nI nod. I don\\'t know why I said anything at all. \\nAlthough if I\\'m going to lose, I\\'d rather Peeta win than \\nthe others. Better for our district, for my mother and \\nPrim. \\n\\nAfter about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I \\nsmooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk \\ninto the gymnasium. Instantly, I know I\\'m in trouble. \\nThey\\'ve been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat \\nthrough twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too \\nmuch to wine, most of them. Want more than \\nanything to go home. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I \\nwalk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I\\'ve \\nbeen itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows \\nmade of wood and plastic and metal and materials I \\ncan\\'t even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless \\nuniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, and sling the \\nmatching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. There\\'s \\na shooting range, but it\\'s much too limited. Standard \\nbull\\'s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the \\ncenter of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The \\ndummy used for knife practice. Even as I pull back on \\nthe bow I know something is wrong. The string\\'s \\ntighter than the one I use at home. The arrow\\'s more \\nrigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches and \\nlose what little attention I had been commanding. For \\na moment, I\\'m humiliated, then I head back to the \\nbull\\'s-eye. I shoot again and again until I get the feel \\nof these new weapons. \\n\\nBack in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial \\nposition and skewer the dummy right through the \\nheart. Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag \\nfor boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the \\nground. Without pausing, I shoulder-roll forward, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ncome up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of \\nthe hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A \\nshower of sparks bursts from the fixture. \\n\\nIt\\'s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A \\nfew are nodding approval, but the majority of them \\nare fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their \\nbanquet table. \\n\\nSuddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, \\nthey don\\'t even have the decency to pay attention to \\nme. That I\\'m being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart \\nstarts to pound, I can feel my face burning. Without \\nthinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it \\nstraight at the Gamemakers\\' table. I hear shouts of \\nalarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the \\napple in the pig\\'s mouth and pins it to the wall \\nbehind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. \\n\\n\"Thank you for your consideration,\" I say. Then I give \\na slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without \\nbeing dismissed. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\n\\nAs I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one \\nside and my quiver to the other. I brush past the \\ngaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the \\nnumber twelve button with my fist. The doors slide \\ntogether and I zip upward. I actually make it back to \\nmy floor before the tears start running down my \\ncheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the \\nsitting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, \\nbolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then I \\nreally begin to sob. \\n\\nNow I\\'ve done it! Now I\\'ve ruined everything! If I\\'d \\nstood even a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent \\nthat arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they \\ndo to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my \\ntongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the \\nfuture tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, \\nshooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn\\'t, I \\nwas shooting at that apple because I was so angry at \\nbeing ignored. I wasn\\'t trying to kill one of them. If I \\nwere, they\\'d be dead! \\n\\nOh, what does it matter? It\\'s not like I was going to \\nwin the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to \\nme? What really scares me is what they might do to \\nmy mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now \\nbecause of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few \\nbelongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to \\nthe community home, or kill them? They wouldn\\'t kill \\nthem, would they? Why not? What do they care? \\n\\nI should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like \\nit was a big joke. Then maybe I would have found \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nsome leniency. But instead I stalked out of the place \\nin the most disrespectful manner possible. \\n\\nHaymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout \\nfor them to go away and eventually they do. It takes \\nat least an hour for me to cry myself out. Then I just \\nlay curled up on the bed, stroking the silken sheets, \\nwatching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol. \\n\\nAt first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time \\npasses, it seems less likely. I calm down. They still \\nneed a girl tribute from District 12, don\\'t they? If the \\nGamemakers want to punish me, they can do it \\npublicly. Wait until I\\'m in the arena and sic starving \\nwild animals on me. You can bet they\\'ll make sure I \\ndon\\'t have a bow and arrow to defend myself. \\n\\nBefore that though, they\\'ll give me a score so low, no \\none in their right mind would sponsor me. That\\'s \\nwhat will happen tonight. Since the training isn\\'t \\nopen to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score \\nfor each player. It gives the audience a starting place \\nfor the betting that will continue throughout the \\nGames. The number, which is between one and \\ntwelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being \\nunattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. \\nThe mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. \\nIt\\'s only an indication of the potential a tribute \\nshowed in training. Often, because of the variables in \\nthe actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down \\nalmost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who \\nwon the Games only received a three. Still, the scores \\ncan help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of \\nsponsorship. I had been hoping my shooting skills \\nmight get me a six or a seven, even if I\\'m not \\nparticularly powerful. Now I\\'m sure 111 have the \\nlowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors \\nme, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I \\ndecide I may as well go. The scores will be televised \\ntonight. It\\'s not like I can hide what happened forever. \\nI go to the bathroom and wash my face, but it\\'s still \\nred and splotchy. \\n\\nEveryone\\'s waiting at the table, even Cinna and \\nPortia. I wish the stylists hadn\\'t shown up because \\nfor some reason, I don\\'t like the idea of disappointing \\nthem. It\\'s as if I\\'ve thrown away all the good work \\nthey did on the opening ceremonies without a \\nthought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny \\nspoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of \\nmy tears. \\n\\nThe adults begin some chitchat about the weather \\nforecast, and I let my eyes meet Peeta\\'s. He raises his \\neyebrows. A question. What happened? I just give my \\nhead a small shake. Then, as they\\'re serving the main \\ncourse, I hear Haymitch say, \"Okay, enough small \\ntalk, just how bad were you today?\" \\n\\nPeeta jumps in. \"I don\\'t know that it mattered. By the \\ntime I showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. \\nThey were singing some kind of drinking song, I \\nthink. So, I threw around some heavy objects until \\nthey told me I could go.\" \\n\\nThat makes me feel a bit better. It\\'s not like Peeta \\nattacked the Gamemakers, but at least he was \\nprovoked, too. \\n\\n\"And you, sweetheart?\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nSomehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me \\noff enough that I\\'m at least able to speak. \"I shot an \\narrow at the Gamemakers.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nEveryone stops eating. \"You what?\" The horror in \\nEffie\\'s voice confirms my worse suspicions. \\n\\n\"I shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their \\ndirection. It\\'s like Peeta said, I was shooting and they \\nwere ignoring me and I just ... I just lost my head, so I \\nshot an apple out of their stupid roast pig\\'s mouth!\" I \\nsay defiantly. \\n\\n\"And what did they say?\" says Cinna carefully. \\n\\n\"Nothing. Or I don\\'t know. I walked out after that,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Without being dismissed?\" gasps Effie. \\n\\n\"I dismissed myself,\" I said. I remember how I \\npromised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel \\nlike a ton of coal has dropped on me. \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s that,\"says Haymitch. Then he butters a \\nroll. \\n\\n\"Do you think they 11 arrest me?\" I ask. \"Doubt it. Be a \\npain to replace you at this stage, \"says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"What about my family?\"Isay. \"Will they punish \\nthem?\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t think so. Wouldn\\'t make much sense. See \\nthey\\'d have to reveal what happened in the Training \\nCenter for it to have any worthwhile effect on the \\npopulation. People would need to know what you did. \\nBut they can\\'t since it\\'s secret, so it\\'d be a waste of \\neffort,\" says Haymitch. \"More likely they\\'ll make your \\nlife hell in the arena.\" \\n\\n\"Well, they\\'ve already promised to do that to us any \\nway,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very true,\" says Haymitch. And I realize the \\nimpossible has happened. They have actually cheered \\nme up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his \\nfingers, which makes Effie frown, and dunks it in his \\nwine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to \\nchuckle. \"What were their faces like?\" \\n\\nI can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. \"Shocked. \\nTerrified. Uh, ridiculous, some of them.\" An image \\npops into my mind. \"One man tripped backward into \\na bowl of punch.\" \\n\\nHaymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except \\nEffie, although even she is suppressing a smile. \"Well, \\nit serves them right. It\\'s their job to pay attention to \\nyou. And just because you come from District Twelve \\nis no excuse to ignore you.\" Then her eyes dart \\naround as if she\\'s said something totally \\noutrageous. \"I\\'m sorry, but that\\'s what I think,\" she \\nsays to no one in particular. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll get a very bad score,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Scores only matter if they\\'re very good, no one pays \\nmuch attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all \\nthey know, you could be hiding your talents to get a \\nlow score on purpose. People use that strategy,\" said \\nPortia. \\n\\n\"I hope that\\'s how people interpret the four I\\'ll \\nprobably get,\" says Peeta. \"If that. Really, is anything \\nless impressive than watching a person pick up a \\nheavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost \\nlanded on my foot.\" \\n\\nI grin at him and realize that I\\'m starving. I cut off a \\npiece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start \\neating. It\\'s okay. My family is safe. And if they are \\nsafe, no real harm has been done. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAfter dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores \\nannounced on television. First they show a photo of \\nthe tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career \\nTributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most \\nof the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little \\nRue comes up with a seven. I don\\'t know what she \\nshowed the judges, but she\\'s so tiny it must have \\nbeen impressive. \\n\\nDistrict 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an \\neight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must \\nhave been watching him. I dig my fingernails into my \\npalms as my face comes up, expecting the worst. \\nThen they\\'re flashing the number eleven on the \\nscreen. \\n\\nEleven! \\n\\nEffie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is \\nslapping me on the back and cheering and \\ncongratulating me. But it doesn\\'t seem real. \\n\\n\"There must be a mistake. How ... how could that \\nhappen?\" I ask Haymitch. \\n\\n\"Guess they liked your temper,\" he says. \"They\\'ve got \\na show to put on. They need some players with some \\nheat.\" \\n\\n\"Katniss, the girl who was on fire,\" says Cinna and \\ngives me a hug. \"Oh, wait until you see your interview \\ndress.\" \"More flames?\" I ask. \"Of a sort,\" he says \\nmischievously. \\n\\nPeeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward \\nmoment. We\\'ve both done well, but what does that \\nmean for the other? I escape to my room as quickly as \\npossible and burrow down under the covers. The \\nstress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nout. I drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the \\nnumber eleven still flashing behind my eyelids. \\n\\nAt dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun \\ncome up on a beautiful morning. It\\'s Sunday. A day \\noff at home. I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. \\nUsually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the \\nweek. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then \\ntrading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both \\nof us can hunt alone, but we\\'re better as a pair. \\nParticularly if we\\'re trying for bigger game. But also in \\nthe littler things, having a partner lightened the load, \\ncould even make the arduous task of filling my \\nfamily\\'s table enjoyable. \\n\\nI had been struggling along on my own for about six \\nmonths when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was \\na Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with \\ndying things. I\\'d spent the morning competing with \\nthe squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer \\nafternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting \\nkatniss. The only meat I\\'d shot was a squirrel that \\nhad practically run over my toes in its quest for \\nacorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the \\nsnow buried my other food sources. Having strayed \\nfarther afield than usual, I was hurrying back home, \\nlugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead \\nrabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot \\nabove my head. About fifteen yards away was \\nanother. I recognized the twitch-up snares because \\nmy father had used them. When the prey is caught, \\nit\\'s yanked into the air out of the reach of other \\nhungry animals. I\\'d been trying to use snares all \\nsummer with no success, so I couldn\\'t help dropping \\nmy sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on \\nthe wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang \\nout. \"That\\'s dangerous.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from \\nbehind a tree. He must have been watching me the \\nwhole time. He was only fourteen, but he cleared six \\nfeet and was as good as an adult to me. I\\'d seen him \\naround the Seam and at school. And one other time. \\nHe\\'d lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. \\nIn January, I\\'d stood by while he received his medal \\nof valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child \\nwith no father. I remembered his two little brothers \\nclutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly \\nannounced she was just days away from giving birth. \\n\\n\"What\\'s your name?\" he said, coming over and \\ndisengaging the rabbit from the snare. He had \\nanother three hanging from his belt. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" I said, barely audible. \\n\\n\"Well, Catnip, stealing\\'s punishable by death, or \\nhadn\\'t you heard?\" he said. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" I said louder. \"And I wasn\\'t stealing it. I \\njust wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch \\nanything.\" \\n\\nHe scowled at me, not convinced. \"So where\\'d you get \\nthe squirrel?\" \\n\\n\"I shot it.\" I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still \\nusing the small version my father had made me, but \\nI\\'d been practicing with the full-size one when I could. \\nI was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring \\ndown some bigger game. \\n\\nGale\\'s eyes fastened on the bow. \"Can I see that?\" I \\nhanded it over. \"Just remember, stealing\\'s punishable \\nby death.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the first time I ever saw him smile. It \\ntransformed him from someone menacing to someone \\nyou wished you knew. But it took several months \\nbefore I returned that smile. \\n\\nWe talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to \\nget him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. \\nI wanted knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares \\nthat caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed \\nsomething might be worked out. As the seasons went \\nby, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our \\nweapons, our secret places that were thick with wild \\nplums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. I \\nshowed him what plants to eat and eventually gave \\nhim one of our precious bows. And then one day, \\nwithout either of us saying it, we became a team. \\nDividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that \\nboth our families had food. \\n\\nGale gave me a sense of securityl\\'dlacked since my \\nfather\\'s death. His companionship replaced the long \\nsolitary hours in the woods. I became a much better \\nhunter when I didn\\'t have to look over my shoulder \\nconstantly, when someone was watching my back. \\nBut he turned into so much more than a hunting \\npartner. He became my confidante, someone with \\nwhom I could share thoughts I could never voice \\ninside the fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. \\nBeing out in the woods with Gale . . . sometimes I was \\nactually happy. \\n\\nI call him my friend, but in the last year it\\'s seemed \\ntoo casual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of \\nlonging shoots through my chest. If only he was with \\nme now! But, of course, I don\\'t want that. I don\\'t want \\nhim in the arena where he\\'d be dead in a few days. I \\njust ... I just miss him. And I hate being so alone. \\nDoes he miss me? He must. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI think of the eleven flashing under my name last \\nnight. I know exactly what he\\'d say to me. \"Well, \\nthere\\'s some room for improvement there.\" And then \\nhe\\'d give me a smile and I\\'d return it without \\nhesitating now. \\n\\nI can\\'t help comparing what I have with Gale to what \\nI\\'m pretending to have with Peeta. How I never \\nquestion Gale\\'s motives while I do nothing but doubt \\nthe latter\\'s. It\\'s not a fair comparison really. Gale and \\nI were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. \\nPeeta and I know the other\\'s survival means our own \\ndeath. How do you sidestep that? \\n\\nEffie\\'s knocking at the door, reminding me there\\'s \\nanother \"big, big, big day!\" ahead. Tomorrow night \\nwill be our televised interviews. I guess the whole \\nteam will have their hands full readying us for that. \\n\\nI get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more \\ncareful about the buttons I hit, and head down to the \\ndining room. Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled \\naround the table talking in hushed voices. That \\nseems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity and I \\nload up my plate with breakfast before I join them. \\n\\nThe stew\\'s made with tender chunks of lamb and \\ndried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. I\\'ve \\nshoveled about halfway through the mound when I \\nrealize no one\\'s talking. I take a big gulp of orange \\njuice and wipe my mouth. \"So, what\\'s going on? \\nYou\\'re coaching us on interviews today, right?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"You don\\'t have to wait until I\\'m done. I can listen \\nand cat at the same time,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s been a change of plans. About our \\ncurrent approach,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" I ask. I\\'m not sure what our current \\napproach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the \\nother tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember. \\n\\nHaymitch shrugs. \"Peeta has asked to be coached \\nseparately.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBetrayal. That\\'s the first thing I feel, which is \\nludicrous. For there to be betrayal, there would have \\nhad to been trust first. Between Peeta and me. And \\ntrust has not been part of the agreement. We\\'re \\ntributes. But the boy who risked a beating to give me \\nbread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who \\ncovered for me with the redheaded Avox girl, who \\ninsisted Haymitch know my hunting skills . . . was \\nthere some part of me that couldn\\'t help trusting \\nhim? \\n\\nOn the other hand, I\\'m relieved that we can stop the \\npretense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin \\nconnection we\\'d foolishly formed has been severed. \\nAnd high time, too. The Games begin in two days, and \\ntrust will only be a weakness. Whatever triggered \\nPeeta\\'s decision \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I suspect it had to do with my \\noutperforming him in training \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I should be nothing \\nbut grateful for it. Maybe he\\'s finally accepted the fact \\nthat the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are \\nenemies, the better. \\n\\n\"Good,\" I say. \"So what\\'s the schedule?\" \\n\\n\"Youll each have four hours with Effie for \\npresentation and four with me for content,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"You start with Effie, Katniss.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t imagine what Effie will have to teach me that \\ncould take four hours, but she\\'s got me working down \\nto the last minute. We go to my rooms and she puts \\nme inafull-length gown and high-heeled shoes, not \\nthe ones I\\'ll he wearing for the actual interview, and \\ninstructs me on walking. The shoes are the worst \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\npart. I\\'ve never worn high heels and can\\'t get used to \\nessentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet. \\nBut Effie runs around in them full-time, and I\\'m \\ndetermined that if she can do it, so can I. The dress \\nposes another problem. It keeps tangling around my \\nshoes so, of course, I hitch it up, and then Effie \\nswoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my hands \\nand yelling, \"Not above the ankle!\" When I finally \\nconquer walking, there\\'s still sitting, posture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\napparently I have a tendency to duck my head \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eye \\ncontact, hand gestures, and smiling. Smiling is \\nmostly about smiling more. Effie makes me say a \\nhundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while \\nsmiling, or ending with a smile. By lunch, the \\nmuscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse. \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s the best I can do,\" Effie says with a sigh. \\n\"Just remember, Katniss, you want the audience to \\nlike you.\" \\n\\n\"And you don\\'t think they will?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not if you glare at them the entire time. Why don\\'t \\nyou save that for the arena? Instead, think of yourself \\namong friends, \"says Effie. \\n\\n\"They\\'re betting on how long I\\'ll live!\" I burst \\nout. \"They\\'re not my friends!\" \\n\\n\"Well, try and pretend!\" snaps Effie. Then she \\ncomposes herself and beams at me. \"See, like this. I\\'m \\nsmiling at you even though you\\'re aggravating me.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, it feels very convincing,\" I say. \"I\\'m going to eat.\" \\n1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining \\nroom, hiking my skirt up to my thighs. \\n\\nPeeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so \\nI\\'m thinking the content session should be an \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nimprovement over the morning. I couldn\\'t be more \\nwrong. After lunch, Haymitch takes me into the \\nsitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just \\nfrowns at me for a while. \\n\\n\"What?\" I finally ask. \\n\\n\"I\\'m trying to figure out what to do with you,\" he \\nsays. \"How we\\'re going to present you. Are you going \\nto be charming? Aloof? Fierce? So far, you\\'re shining \\nlike a star. You volunteered to save your sister. Cinna \\nmade you look unforgettable. You\\'ve got the top \\ntraining score. People are intrigued, but no one knows \\nwho you are. The impression you make tomorrow will \\ndecide exactly what I can get you in terms of \\nsponsors,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nHaving watched the tribute interviews all my life, I \\nknow there\\'s truth to what he\\'s saying. If you appeal \\nto the crowd, either by being humorous or brutal or \\neccentric, you gain favor. \\n\\n\"What\\'s Peeta\\'s approach? Or am I not allowed to \\nask?\" I say. \\n\\n\"Likable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor \\nnaturally,\" says Haymitch. \"Whereas when you open \\nyour mouth, you come across more as sullen and \\nhostile.\" \\n\\n\"I do not!\" I say. \\n\\n\"Please. I don\\'t know where you pulled that cheery, \\nwavy girl on the chariot from, but I haven\\'t seen her \\nbefore or since,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\"And you\\'ve given me so many reasons to be cheery,\" I \\ncounter. \\n\\n\\n\\nIll | P a g e \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you don\\'t have to please me. I\\'m not going to \\nsponsor you. So pretend I\\'m the audience,\" says \\nHaymitch. \"Delight me.\" \\n\\n\"Fine!\" I snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the \\ninterviewer and I try to answer his questions in a \\nwinning fashion. But I can\\'t. I\\'m too angry with \\nHaymitch for what he said and that I even have to \\nanswer the questions. All I can think is how unjust \\nthe whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I \\nhopping around like some trained dog trying to please \\npeople I hate? The longer the interview goes on, the \\nmore my fury seems to rise to the surface, until I\\'m \\nliterally spitting out answers at him. \\n\\n\"All right, enough,\" he says. \"We\\'ve got to find another \\nangle. Not only are you hostile, I don\\'t know anything \\nabout you. I\\'ve asked you fifty questions and still have \\nno sense of your life, your family, what you care \\nabout. They want to know about you, Katniss.\" \\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want them to! They\\'re already taking my \\nfuture! They can\\'t have the things that mattered to \\nme in the past!\" I say. \\n\\n\"Then lie! Make something up!\" says Haymitch. \\n\"I\\'m not good at lying,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Well, you better learn fast. You\\'ve got about as much \\ncharm as a dead slug,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nOuch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know he\\'s \\nbeen too harsh because his voice softens. \"Here\\'s an \\nidea. Try acting humble.\" \\n\\n\"Humble,\" I echo. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"That you can\\'t believe a little girl from District Twelve \\nhas done this well. The whole thing\\'s been more than \\nyou ever could have dreamed of. Talk about Cinna\\'s \\nclothes. How nice the people are. How the city amazes \\nyou. If you won\\'t talk about yourself, at least \\ncompliment the audience. Just keep turning it back \\naround, all right. Gush.\" \\n\\nThe next hours are agonizing. At once, it\\'s clear I \\ncannot gush. We try me playing cocky, but I just don\\'t \\nhave the arrogance. Apparently, I\\'m too \"vulnerable\" \\nfor ferocity. I\\'m not witty. Funny. Sexy. Or \\nmysterious. \\n\\nBy the end of the session, I am no one at all. \\nHaymitch started drinking somewhere around witty, \\nand a nasty edge has crept into his voice. \"I give up, \\nsweetheart. Just answer the questions and try not to \\nlet the audience see how openly you despise them.\" \\n\\nI have dinner that night in my room, ordering an \\noutrageous number of delicacies, eating myself sick, \\nand then taking out my anger at Haymitch, at the \\nHunger Games, at every living being in the Capitol by \\nsmashing dishes around my room. When the girl with \\nthe red hair comes in to turn down my bed, her eyes \\nwiden at the mess. \"Just leave it!\" I yell at her. \"Just \\nleave it alone!\" \\n\\nI hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes \\nthat call me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the \\nCapitol, both now and then. For her, justice must \\nfinally be happening. At least my death will help pay \\nfor the life of the boy in the woods. \\n\\nBut instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the \\ndoor behind her and goes to the bathroom. She comes \\nback with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthen cleans the blood from a broken plate off my \\nhands. Why is she doing this? Why am I letting her? \\n\\n\"I should have tried to save you,\" I whisper. \\n\\nShe shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to \\nstand by? That she has forgiven me? \\n\\n\"No, it was wrong,\" I say. \\n\\nShe taps her lips with her fingers then points to my \\nchest. I think she means that I would just have ended \\nup an Avox, too. Probably would have. An Avox or \\ndead. \\n\\nI spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl \\nclean the room. When all the garbage has been \\ndropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away, \\nshe turns down my bed. I crawl in between the sheets \\nlike a five-year-old and let her tuck me in. Then she \\ngoes. I want her to stay until I fall asleep. To be there \\nwhen I wake up. I want the protection of this girl, \\neven though she never had mine. \\n\\nIn the morning, it\\'s not the girl but my prep team who \\nare hanging over me. My lessons with Effie and \\nHaymitch are over. This day belongs to Cinna. He\\'s \\nmy last hope. Maybe he can make me look so \\nwonderful, no one will care what comes out of my \\nmouth. \\n\\nThe team works on me until late afternoon, turning \\nmy skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my \\narms, painting flame designs on my twenty perfect \\nnails. Then Venia goes to work on my hair, weaving \\nstrands of red into a pattern that begins at my left \\near, wraps around my head, and then falls in one \\nbraid down my right shoulder. They erase my face \\nwith a layer of pale makeup and draw my features \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nback out. Huge dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that \\nthrow off bits of light when I blink. Finally, they cover \\nmy entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer \\nin gold dust. \\n\\nThen Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, \\nbut I can\\'t really see it because it\\'s covered. \"Close \\nyour eyes,\" he orders. \\n\\nI can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over \\nmy naked body, then the weight. It must be forty \\npounds. I clutch Octavia\\'s hand as I blindly step into \\nmy shoes, glad to find they are at least two inches \\nlower than the pair Effie had me practice in. There\\'s \\nsome adjusting and fidgeting. Then silence. \\n\\n\"Can I open my eyes?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Yes,\" says Cinna. \"Open them.\" \\n\\nThe creature standing before me in the full-length \\nmirror has come from another world. Where skin \\nshimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make \\ntheir clothes from jewels. Because my dress, oh, my \\ndress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems, \\nred and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent \\nthe tips of the flame design. The slightest movement \\ngives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire. \\n\\nI am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as \\nthe sun. \\n\\nFor a while, we all just stare at me. \"Oh, Cinna,\" I \\nfinally whisper. \"Thank you.\" \\n\\n\"Twirl for me,\" he says. I hold out my arms and spin \\nin a circle. The prep team screams in admiration. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nCinna dismisses the team and has me move around \\nin the dress and shoes, which are infinitely more \\nmanageable than Effie\\'s. The dress hangs in such a \\nway that I don\\'t have to lift the skirt when I walk, \\nleaving me with one less thing to worry about. \\n\\n\"So, all ready for the interview then?\" asks Cinna. I \\ncan see by his expression that he\\'s been talking to \\nHaymitch. That he knows how dreadful I am. \\n\\n\"I\\'m awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No \\nmatter what we tried, I couldn\\'t do it. I just can\\'t be \\none of those people he wants me to be,\" I say. \\n\\nCinna thinks about this a moment. \"Why don\\'t you \\njust be yourself?\" \\n\\n\"Myself? That\\'s no good, either. Haymitch says I\\'m \\nsullen and hostile,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Well, you are ... around Haymitch,\" says Cinna with \\na grin. \"I don\\'t find you so. The prep team adores you. \\nYou even won over the Gamemakers. And as for the \\ncitizens of the Capitol, well, they can\\'t stop talking \\nabout you. No one can help but admire your spirit.\" \\n\\nMy spirit. This is a new thought. I\\'m not sure exactly \\nwhat it means, but it suggests I\\'m a fighter. In a sort \\nof brave way. It\\'s not as if I\\'m never friendly. Okay, \\nmaybe I don\\'t go around loving everybody I meet, \\nmaybe my smiles are hard to come by, but I do care \\nfor some people. \\n\\nCinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. \\n\"Suppose, when you answer the questions, you think \\nyou\\'re addressing a friend back home. Who would \\nyour best friend be?\" asks Cinna. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gale,\" I say instantly. \"Only it doesn\\'t make sense, \\nCinna. I would never be telling Gale those things \\nabout me. He already knows them.\" \\n\\n\"What about me? Could you think of me as a friend?\" \\nasks Cinna. \\n\\nOf all the people I\\'ve met since I left home, Cinna is \\nby far my favorite. I liked him right off and he hasn\\'t \\ndisappointed me yet. \"I think so, but \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be sitting on the main platform with the other \\nstylists. You\\'ll be able to look right at me. When \\nyou\\'re asked a question, find me, and answer it as \\nhonestly as possible,\" says Cinna. \\n\\n\"Even if what I think is horrible?\" I ask. Because it \\nmight be, really. \\n\\n\"Especially if what you think is horrible,\" says \\nCinna. \"Youll try it?\" \\n\\nI nod. It\\'s a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at. \\n\\nToo soon it\\'s time to go. The interviews take place on \\na stage constructed in front of the Training Center. \\nOnce I leave my room, it will be only minutes until I\\'m \\nin front of the crowd, the cameras, all of Panem. \\n\\nAs Cinna turns the doorknob, I stop his hand. \"Cinna \\n...\" I\\'m completely overcome with stage fright. \\n\\n\"Remember, they already love you,\" he says gently. \\n\"Just be yourself.\" \\n\\nWe meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at \\nthe elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at \\nwork. Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame \\naccents. While we look well together, it\\'s a relief not to \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nbe dressed identically. Haymitch and Effie are all \\nfancied up for the occasion. I avoid Haymitch, but \\naccept Effie \\'s compliments. Effie can be tiresome and \\nclueless, but she\\'s not destructive like Haymitch. \\n\\nWhen the elevator opens, the other tributes are being \\nlined up to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in \\na big arc throughout the interviews. Ill be last, or \\nsecond to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy \\nfrom each district. How I wish I could be first and get \\nthe whole thing out of the way! Now 111 have to listen \\nto how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and charming \\neverybody else is before I go up. Plus, the audience \\nwill start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. \\nAnd I can\\'t exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to \\nget their attention. \\n\\nRight before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch \\ncomes up behind Peeta and me and growls, \\n\"Remember, you\\'re still a happy pair. So act like it.\" \\n\\nWhat? I thought we abandoned that when Peeta \\nasked for separate coaching. But I guess that was a \\nprivate, not a public thing. Anyway, there\\'s not much \\nchance for interaction now, as we walk single-file to \\nour seats and take our places. \\n\\nJust stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid \\nand shallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my \\ntemples. It\\'s a relief to get to my chair, because \\nbetween the heels and my legs shaking, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll \\ntrip. Although evening is falling, the City Circle is \\nbrighter than a summer\\'s day. An elevated seating \\nunit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the \\nstylists commanding the front row. The cameras will \\nturn to them when the crowd is reacting to their \\nhandiwork. A large balcony off a building to the right \\nhas been reserved for the Gamemakers. Television \\ncrews have claimed most of the other balconies. But \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthe City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are \\ncompletely packed with people. Standing room only. \\nAt homes and community halls around the country, \\nevery television set is turned on. Every citizen of \\nPanem is tuned in. There will be no blackouts tonight. \\n\\nCaesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the \\ninterviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the \\nstage. It\\'s a little scary because his appearance has \\nbeen virtually unchanged during all that time. Same \\nface under a coating of pure white makeup. Same \\nhairstyle that he dyes a different color for each \\nHunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue \\ndotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that \\ntwinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to \\nmake people appear younger and thinner. In District \\n12, looking old is something of an achievement since \\nso many people die early. You see an elderly person \\nyou want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask \\nthe secret of survival. A plump person is envied \\nbecause they aren\\'t scraping by like the majority of \\nus. But here it is different. Wrinkles aren\\'t desirable. \\nA round belly isn\\'t a sign of success. \\n\\nThis year, Caesar\\'s hair is powder blue and his \\neyelids and lips are coated in the same hue. He looks \\nfreakish but less frightening than he did last year \\nwhen his color was crimson and he seemed to be \\nbleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the \\naudience but then gets down to business. \\n\\nThe girl tribute from District 1 , looking provocative in \\na see-through gold gown, steps up the center of the \\nstage to join Caesar for her interview. You can tell her \\nmentor didn\\'t have any trouble coming up with an \\nangle for her. With that flowing blonde hair, emerald \\ngreen eyes, her body tall and lush ... she\\'s sexy all the \\nway. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nEach interview only lasts three minutes. Then a \\nbuzzer goes off and the next tribute is up. Ill say this \\nfor Caesar, he really does his best to make the \\ntributes shine. He\\'s friendly, tries to set the nervous \\nones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and can turn a \\nweak response into a memorable one by the way he \\nreacts. \\n\\nI sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the \\ndistricts slip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing \\nup some angle. The monstrous boy from District 2 is \\na ruthless killing machine. The fox-faced girl from \\nDistrict 5 sly and elusive. I spotted Cinna as soon as \\nhe took his place, but even his presence cannot relax \\nme. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very quiet. \\nMy palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled \\ndress isn\\'t absorbent and they skid right of if I try to \\ndry them. 1 1 . \\n\\nRue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete \\nwith wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls \\nover the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a \\ntribute. Caesar\\'s very sweet with her, complimenting \\nher seven in training, an excellent score for one so \\nsmall. When he asks her what her greatest strength \\nin the arena will be, she doesn\\'t hesitate. \"I\\'m very \\nhard to catch, \"she says in a tremulous voice. \"And if \\nthey can\\'t catch me, they can\\'t kill me. So don\\'t count \\nme out.\" \\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t in a million years,\" says Caesar \\nencouragingly. \\n\\nThe boy tribute from District 1 1 , Thresh, has the \\nsame dark skin as Rue, but the resemblance stops \\nthere. He\\'s one of the giants, probably six and a half \\nfeet tall and built like an ox, but I noticed he rejected \\nthe invitations from the Career Tributes to join their \\ncrowd. Instead he\\'s been very solitary, speaking to no \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\none, showing little interest in training. Even so, he \\nscored a ten and it\\'s not hard to imagine he \\nimpressed the Gamemakers. He ignores Caesar\\'s \\nattempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or \\njust remains silent. \\n\\nIf only I was his size, I could get away with sullen and \\nhostile and it would be just fine! I bet half the \\nsponsors are at least considering him. If I had any \\nmoney, I\\'d bet on him myself. \\n\\nAnd then they\\'re calling Katniss Everdeen, and I feel \\nmyself, as if in a dream, standing and making my way \\ncenter stage. I shake Caesar\\'s outstretched hand, and \\nhe has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off \\non his suit. \\n\\n\"So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from \\nDistrict Twelve. What\\'s impressed you most since you \\narrived here?\"asks Caesar. \\n\\nWhat? What did he say? It\\'s as if the words make no \\nsense. \\n\\nMy mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately \\nfind Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. I \\nimagine the words coming from his lips. \"What\\'s \\nimpressed you most since you arrived here?\" I rack \\nmy brain for something that made me happy here. Be \\nhonest, I think. Be honest. \\n\\n\"The lamb stew,\" I get out. \\n\\nCaesar laughs, and vaguely I realize some of the \\naudience has joined in. \\n\\n\"The one with the dried plums?\" asks Caesar. I nod. \\n\"Oh, I eat it by the bucketful.\" He turns sideways to \\nthe audience in horror, hand on his stomach. \"It \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ndoesn\\'t show, does it?\" They shout reassurances to \\nhim and applaud. This is what I mean about Caesar. \\nHe tries to help you out. \\n\\n\"Now, Katniss,\" he says confidentially, \"When you \\ncame out in the opening ceremonies, my heart \\nactually stopped. What did you think of that \\ncostume?\" \\n\\nCinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. \"You \\nmean after I got over my fear of being burned alive?\" I \\nask. \\n\\nBig laugh. A real one from the audience. \\n\"Yes. Start then,\" says Caesar. \\n\\nCinna, my friend, I should tellhimanyway.\"I thought \\nCinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous \\ncostume I\\'d ever seen and I couldn\\'t believe I was \\nwearing it. I can\\'t believe I\\'m wearing this, either.\" I \\nlift up my skirt to spread it out. \"I mean, look at it!\" \\n\\nAs the audience oohs and ahs, I see Cinna make the \\ntiniest circular motion with his finger. But I know \\nwhat he\\'s saying. Twirl for me. \\n\\nI spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate. \\n\\n\"Oh, do that again!\" says Caesar, and so I lift up my \\narms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly \\nout, letting the dress engulf me in flames. The \\naudience breaks into cheers. When I stop, I clutch \\nCaesar\\'s arm. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t stop!\" he says. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have to, I\\'m dizzy!\" I\\'m also giggling, which I think \\nI\\'ve done maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves \\nand the spinning have gotten to me. \\n\\nCaesar wraps a protective arm around me. \"Don\\'t \\nworry, I\\'ve got you. Can\\'t have you following in your \\nmentor\\'s footsteps.\" \\n\\nEveryone\\'s hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, \\nwho is by now famous for his head dive at the \\nreaping, and he waves them away good-naturedly and \\npoints back to me. \\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" Caesar reassures the crowd. \"She\\'s safe \\nwith me. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. \\nGive us a hint what happened in there.\" \\n\\nI glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite \\nmy lip. \"Um ... all I can say, is I think it was a first.\" \\n\\nThe cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are \\nchuckling and nodding. \\n\\n\"You\\'re killing us,\" says Caesar as if in actual \\npain. \"Details. Details.\" \\n\\nI address the balcony. \"I\\'m not supposed to talk about \\nit, right?\" \\n\\nThe Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts \\nout,\"She\\'s not!\" \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" I say. \"Sorry. My lips are sealed.\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s go back then, to the moment they called your \\nsister\\'s name at the reaping,\" says Caesar. His mood \\nis quieter now. \"And you volunteered. Can you tell us \\nabout her?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nNo. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. I don\\'t think \\nI\\'m imagining the sadness on his face. \"Her name\\'s \\nPrim. She\\'s just twelve. And I love her more than \\nanything.\" \\n\\nYou could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now. \\n\\n\"What did she say to you? After the reaping?\" Caesar \\nasks. \\n\\nBe honest. Be honest. I swallow hard. \"She asked me \\nto try really hard to win.\" The audience is frozen, \\nhanging on my every word. \\n\\n\"And what did you say?\" prompts Caesar gently. \\n\\nBut instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over \\nmy body. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. \\nWhen I speak, my voice seems to have dropped an \\noctave. \"I swore I would.\" \\n\\n\"I bet you did,\" says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The \\nbuzzer goes off. \"Sorry we\\'re out of time. Best of luck, \\nKatniss Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve.\" \\n\\nThe applause continues long after I\\'m seated. I look to \\nCinna for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs- \\nup. \\n\\nI\\'m still in a daze for the first part of Peeta\\'s interview. \\nHe has the audience from the get-go, though; I can \\nhear them laughing, shouting out. He plays up the \\nbaker\\'s son thing, comparing the tributes to the \\nbreads from their districts. Then has a funny \\nanecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers. \"Tell \\nme, do I still smell like roses?\" he asks Caesar, and \\nthen there\\'s a whole run where they take turns \\nsniffing each other that brings down the house. I\\'m \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ncoming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he \\nhas a girlfriend back home. \\n\\nPeeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of \\nhis head. \\n\\n\"Handsome lad like you. There must be some special \\ngirl. Come on, what\\'s her name?\" says Caesar. \\n\\nPeeta sighs. \"Well, there is this one girl. I\\'ve had a \\ncrush on her ever since I can remember. But I\\'m \\npretty sure she didn\\'t know I was alive until the \\nreaping.\" \\n\\nSounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love \\nthey can relate to. \\n\\n\"She have another fellow?\" asks Caesar. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, but a lot of boys like her,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"So, here\\'s what you do. You win, you go home. She \\ncan\\'t turn you down then, eh?\" says Caesar \\nencouragingly. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to work out. Winning... won\\'t \\nhelp in my case,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Why ever not?\" says Caesar, mystified. \\n\\nPeeta blushes beet red and stammersout. \"Because... \\nbecause... she came here with me.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPARTI \\n\"THE GAMES\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment, the cameras hold on Peeta\\'s downcast \\neyes as what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, \\nmouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest, \\nmagnified on every screen as I realize, Me! He means \\nme! I press my lips together and stare at the floor, \\nhoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil \\nup inside of me. \\n\\n\"Oh, that is a piece of bad luck,\" says Caesar, and \\nthere\\'s a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is \\nmurmuring in agreement, a few have even given \\nagonized cries. \\n\\n\"It\\'s not good,\" agrees Peeta. \\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t think any of us can blame you. It\\'d be \\nhard not to fall for that young lady,\" says Caesar. \\n\"She didn\\'t know?\" \\n\\nPeeta shakes his head. \"Not until now.\" \\n\\nI allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long \\nenough to see that the blush on my cheeks is \\nunmistakable. \\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you love to pull her back out here and get a \\nresponse?\" Caesar asks the audience. The crowd \\nscreams assent. \"Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss \\nEverdeen\\'s time has been spent. Well, best of luck to \\nyou, Peeta Mellark, and I think I speak for all of \\nPanem when I say our hearts go with yours.\" \\n\\nThe roar of the crowdis deafening. Peeta has \\nabsolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ndeclaration of love for me. When the audience finally \\nsettles down, he chokes out a quiet \"Thank you\" and \\nreturns to his seat. We stand for the anthem. I have \\nto raise my head out of the required respect and \\ncannot avoid seeing that every screen is now \\ndominated by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a \\nfew feet that in the viewers \\'heads can never be \\nbreached. Poor tragic us. \\n\\nBut I know better. \\n\\nAfter the anthem, the tributes file back into the \\nTraining Center lobby and onto the elevators. I make \\nsure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. \\nThe crowd slows our entourages of stylists and \\nmentors and chaperones, so we have only each other \\nfor company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to \\ndeposit four tributes before I am alone and then find \\nthe doors opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only \\njust stepped from his car when I slam my palms into \\nhis chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an \\nugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and \\nshatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in \\nthe shards, and blood immediately flows from his \\nhands. \\n\\n\"What was that for?\" he says, aghast. \\n\\n\"You had no right! No right to go saying those things \\nabout me!\" I shout at him. \\n\\nNow the elevators open and the whole crew is there, \\nEffie, Haymitch, Cinna, and Portia. \\n\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" says Effie, a note of hysteria in her \\nvoice. \"Did you fall?\" \\n\\n\"After she shoved me,\" says Peeta asEffie and Cinna \\nhelp him up. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch turns on me. \"Shoved him?\" \\n\\n\"This was your idea, wasn\\'t it? Turning me into some \\nkind of fool in front of the entire country?\" I answer. \\n\\n\"It was my idea,\" says Peeta, wincing as he pulls \\nspikes of pottery from his palms. \"Haymitch just \\nhelped me with it.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you!\" I say. \\n\\n\"You are a fool,\" Haymitch says in disgust. \"Do you \\nthink he hurt you? That boy just gave you something \\nyou could never achieve on your own.\" \\n\\n\"He made me look weak!\" I say. \\n\\n\"He made you look desirable! And let\\'s face it, you can \\nuse all the help you can get in that department. You \\nwere about as romantic as dirt until he said he \\nwanted you. Now they all do. You\\'re all they\\'re talking \\nabout. The star-crossed lovers from District Twelve!\" \\nsays Haymitch. \\n\\n\"But we\\'re not star-crossed lovers!\" I say. \\n\\nHaymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against \\nthe wall. \"Who cares? It\\'s all a big show. It\\'s all how \\nyou\\'re perceived. The most I could say about you after \\nyour interview was that you were nice enough, \\nalthough that in itself was a small miracle. Now I can \\nsay you\\'re a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the boys \\nback home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you \\nthink will get you more sponsors?\" \\n\\nThe smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. I \\nshove his hands off my shoulders and step away, \\ntrying to clear my head. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nCinna comes over and puts his arm around me. \"He\\'s \\nright, Katniss.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t know what to think. \"I should have been told, \\nso I didn\\'t look so stupid.\" \\n\\n\"No, your reaction was perfect. If you\\'d known, it \\nwouldn\\'t have read as real,\" says Portia. \\n\\n\"She\\'s just worried about her boyfriend,\" says Peeta \\ngruffly, tossing away a bloody piece of the urn. \\n\\nMy cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. \"I don\\'t \\nhave a boyfriend.\" \\n\\n\"Whatever,\" says Peeta. \"But I bet he\\'s smart enough \\nto know a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didn\\'t \\nsay you loved me. So what does it matter?\" \\n\\nThe words are sinking in. My anger fading. I\\'m torn \\nnow between thinking I\\'ve been used and thinking I\\'ve \\nbeen given an edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my \\ninterview, but what was I really? A silly girl spinning \\nin a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The only moment of \\nany substance I hail was when I talked about Prim. \\nCompare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, \\nand I\\'m forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. \\nNo, not entirely forgettable, I have my eleven in \\ntraining. \\n\\nBut now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not \\njust his. To hear him tell it I have many admirers. \\nAnd iftheaudience really thinks we\\'re in love ... I \\nremember howstrongly they responded to his \\nconfession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is right, \\nthey eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly I\\'m \\nworried that I didn\\'t react properly. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"After he said he loved me, did you thinkl could be in \\nlove with him, too?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"I did,\" says Portia. \"The way you avoidedlooking at \\nthe cameras, the blush.\" \\n\\nThey others chime in, agreeing. \\n\\n\"You\\'re golden, sweetheart. You\\'re going to have \\nsponsors lined up around the block,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\nI\\'m embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to \\nacknowledge Peeta. \"I\\'m sorry I shoved you.\" \\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t matter,\" he shrugs. \"Although it\\'s technically \\nillegal.\" \\n\\n\"Are your hands okay?\" I ask. \"TheyH be all right,\" he \\nsays. \\n\\nIn the silence that follows, delicious smells of our \\ndinner waft in from the dining room. \"Come on, let\\'s \\neat,\" says Haymitch. We all follow him to the table \\nand take our places. But then Peeta is bleeding too \\nheavily, and Portia leads him off for medical \\ntreatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup \\nwithout them. By the time we\\'ve finished, they\\'re \\nback. Peeta\\'s hands are wrapped in bandages. I can\\'t \\nhelp feeling guilty. Tomorrow we will be in the arena. \\nHe has done me a favor and I have answered with an \\ninjury. Will I never stop owing him? \\n\\nAfter dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. \\nI seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my \\ndress, although the others assure me I am charming. \\nPeeta actually is charming and then utterly winning \\nas the boy in love.Andthere I am, blushing and \\nconfused, madebeautiful by Cinna\\'s hands, desirable \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nby Peeta\\'s confession, tragic by circumstance, and by \\nall accounts, unforgettable. \\n\\nWhen the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, \\na hush falls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will \\nbe roused and prepared for the arena. The actual \\nGames don\\'t start until ten because so many of the \\nCapitol residents rise late. But Peeta and I must make \\nan early start. There is no telling how far we will \\ntravel to the arena that has been prepared for this \\nyear\\'s Games. \\n\\nI know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. \\nAs soon as they leave here, they\\'ll be at the Games \\nHeadquarters, hopefully madly signing up our \\nsponsors, working out a strategy on how and when to \\ndeliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Portia will travel \\nwith us to the very spot from which we will be \\nlaunched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be \\nsaid here. \\n\\nEffie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual \\ntears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being \\nthe best tributes it has ever been her privilege to \\nsponsor. And then, because it\\'s Effie and she\\'s \\napparently required by law to say something awful, \\nshe adds \"I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if I finally get \\npromoted to a decent district next year!\" \\n\\nThen she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries \\nout, overcome with either the emotional parting or the \\npossible improvement of her fortunes. \\n\\nHaymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over. \\n\\n\"Any final words of advice?\" asks Peeta. \\n\\n\"When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. \\nYou\\'re neither of you up to the blood bath at the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nCornucopia. Just clear out, put as much distance as \\nyou can between yourselves and the others, and find \\na source of water,\" he says. \"Got it?\" \\n\\n\"And after that?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Stay alive,\" says Haymitch. It\\'s the same advice he \\ngave us on the train, but he\\'s not drunk and laughing \\nthis time. And we only nod. What else is there to say? \\n\\nWhen I head to my room, Peeta lingers to talk to \\nPortia. I\\'m glad. Whatever strange words of parting we \\nexchange can wait until tomorrow. My covers are \\ndrawn back, but there is no sign of the redheaded \\nAvox girl. I wish I knew her name. I should have \\nasked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it out. \\nBut perhaps that would only result in punishment for \\nher. \\n\\nI take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the \\nmakeup, the scent of beauty from my body. All that \\nremains of the design-team\\'s efforts are the flames on \\nmy nails. I decide to keep them as reminder of who I \\nam to the audience. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. \\nPerhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the \\ndays to come. \\n\\nI pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. \\nIt takes me about five seconds to realize I\\'ll never fall \\nasleep. And I need sleep desperately because in the \\narena every moment I give in to fatigue will be an \\ninvitation to death. \\n\\nIt\\'s no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my \\neyelids refuse to get heavy. I can\\'t stop trying to \\nimagine exactly what terrain I\\'ll be thrown into. \\nDesert? Swamp? A frigid wasteland? Above all I am \\nhoping for trees, which may afford me some means of \\nconcealment and food and shelter, Often there are \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ntrees because barren landscapes are dull and the \\nGames resolve too quickly without them. But what \\nwill the climate be like? What traps have the \\nGamemakers hid den to liven up the slower \\nmoments? And then there are my fellow tributes . . . \\n\\nThe more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it \\neludes me. Finally, I am too restless to even stay in \\nbed. I pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing \\ntoo short. My room feels like a prison cell. If I don\\'t \\nget air soon, I\\'m going to start to throw things again. I \\nrun down the hall to the door to the roof. It\\'s not only \\nunlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, \\nbut it doesn\\'t matter. The energy field enclosing the \\nroof prevents any desperate form of escape. And I\\'m \\nnot looking to escape, only to fill my lungs with air. I \\nwant to see the sky and the moon on the last night \\nthat no one will be hunting me. \\n\\nThe roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel \\nreach its tiled surface I see his silhouette, black \\nagainst the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol. \\nThere\\'s quite a commotion going on down in the \\nstreets, music and singing and car horns, none of \\nwhich I could hear through the thick glass window \\npanels in my room. I could slip away now, without \\nhim noticing me; he wouldn\\'t hear me over the din, \\nBut the night air\\'s so sweet, I can\\'t bear returning to \\nthat stuffy cage of a room. And what difference does it \\nmake? Whether we speak or not? \\n\\nMy feet move soundlessly across the tiles. I\\'m only \\nyard behind him when I say, \"You should be getting \\nsome sleep.\" \\n\\nHe starts but doesn\\'t turn. I can see him give his \\nhead a slight shake. \"I didn\\'t want to miss the party. \\nIt\\'s for us, after all.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI come up beside him and lean over the edge of the \\nrail. The wide streets are full of dancing people. I \\nsquint to make out their tiny figures in more detail. \\n\"Are they in costumes?\" \\n\\n\"Who could tell?\" Peeta answers. \"With all the crazy \\nclothes they wear here. Couldn\\'t sleep, either?\" \\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t turn my mind off,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Thinking about your family?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"No,\" I admit a bit guiltily. \"All I can do is wonder \\nabout tomorrow. Which is pointless, of course.\" In the \\nlight from below, I can see his face now, the awkward \\nway he holds his bandaged hands. \"I really am sorry \\nabout your hands.\" \\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter, Katniss,\" he says. \"I\\'ve never been \\na contender in these Games anyway.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s no way to be thinking,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Why not? It\\'s true. My best hope is to not disgrace \\nmyself and ...\" He hesitates. \\n\\n\"And what?\" I say. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to say it exactly. Only ... I want to \\ndie as myself. Does that make any sense?\" he asks. I \\nshake my head. How could he die as anyone but \\nhimself? \"I don\\'t want them to change me in there. \\nTurn me into some kind of monster that I\\'m not.\" \\n\\nI bite my lip feeling inferior. While I\\'ve been \\nruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been \\nstruggling with how to maintain his identity. His \\npurity of self. \"Do you mean you won\\'t kill anyone?\" I \\nask. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, when the time comes, I\\'m sure I\\'ll kill just like \\neverybody else. I can\\'t go down without a fight. Only I \\nkeep wishing I could think of a way to ... to show the \\nCapitol they don\\'t own me. That I\\'m more than just a \\npiece in their Games,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"But you\\'re not,\" I say. \"None of us are. That\\'s how \\nthe Games work.\" \\n\\n\"Okay, but within that framework, there\\'s still you, \\nthere\\'s still me,\" he insists. \"Don\\'t you see?\" \\n\\n\"A little. Only ... no offense, but who cares, Peeta?\"I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"I do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at \\nthis point?\" he asks angrily. He\\'s locked those blue \\neyes on mine now, demanding an answer. \\n\\nI take a step back. \"Care about what Haymitch said. \\nAbout staying alive.\" \\n\\nPeeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. \"Okay. Thanks \\nfor the tip, sweetheart.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch\\'s \\npatronizing endearment. \"Look, if you want to spend \\nthe last hours of your life planning some noble death \\nin the arena, that\\'s your choice. I want to spend mine \\nin District Twelve.\" \\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t surprise me if you do,\" says Peeta. \"Give \\nmy mother my best when you make it back, will you?\" \\n\\n\"Count on it,\" I say. Then I turn and leave the roof. I \\nspend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a \\ndoze, imagining the cutting remarks I will make to \\nPeeta Mellark in the morning. Peeta Mellark. We will \\nsee how high and mighty he is when he\\'s faced with \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nlife and death. He\\'ll probably turn into one of those \\nraging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat \\nsomeone\\'s heart after they\\'ve killed them. There was a \\nguy like that a few years ago from District 6 called \\nTitus. He went completely savage and the \\nGamemakers had to have him stunned with electric \\nguns to collect the bodies of the players he\\'d killed \\nbefore he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, \\nbut cannibalism doesn\\'t play well with the Capitol \\naudience, so they tried to head it off. There was some \\nspeculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus \\nout was specifically engineered to ensure the victor \\nwas not a lunatic. \\n\\nI don\\'t see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me \\nbefore dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and \\nguides me to the roof. My final dressing and \\npreparations will be alone in the catacombs under the \\narena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just \\nlike the one did in the woods the day I saw the \\nredheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops \\ndown. I place my hands and feet on the lower rungs \\nand instantly it\\'s as if I\\'m frozen. Some sort of current \\nglues me to the ladder while I\\'m lifted safely inside. \\n\\nI expect the ladder to release me then, but I\\'m still \\nstuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me \\ncarrying a syringe. \"This is just your tracker, Katniss. \\nThe stiller you are, the more efficiently I can place it,\" \\nshe says. \\n\\nStill? I\\'m a statue. But that doesn\\'t prevent me from \\nfeeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts \\nthe metal tracking device deep under the skin on the \\ninside of my forearm. Now the Gamemakers will \\nalways be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena. \\nWouldn\\'t want to lose a tribute. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAs soon as the tracker\\'s in place, the ladder releases \\nme. The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved \\nfrom the roof, An Avox boy comes in and directs us to \\na room where breakfast has been laid out. Despite the \\ntension in my stomach,Ieat as much as I can, \\nalthough none of the delectable food makes any \\nimpression on me. I\\'m so nervous, I could be eating \\ncoal dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the \\nview from the windows as we sail over the city and \\nthen to the wilderness beyond. This is what birds see. \\nOnly they\\'re free and safe. The very opposite of me. \\n\\nThe ride lasts about half an hour before the windows \\nblack out, suggesting that we\\'re nearing the arena. \\nThe hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go back to the \\nladder, only this time it leads down into a tube \\nunderground, into the catacombs that lie beneath the \\narena. We follow instructions to my destination, a \\nchamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call \\nit the Launch Room. In the districts, it\\'s referred to as \\nthe Stockyard. The place animals go before slaughter. \\n\\nEverything is brand-new, I will be the first and only \\ntribute to use this Launch Room. The arenas are \\nhistoric sites, preserved after the Games. Popular \\ndestinations for Capitol residents to visit, to vacation. \\nGo for a month, rewatch the Games, tour the \\ncatacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took \\nplace. You can even take part in reenactments. They \\nsay the food is excellent. \\n\\nI struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and \\nclean my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple \\ntrademark braid down my back. Then the clothes \\narrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no \\nsay in my outfit, does not even know what will be in \\nthe package, but he helps me dress in the \\nundergarments, simple tawny pants, light green \\nblouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin, hooded black \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\njacket that falls to my thighs. \"The material in the \\njacket\\'s designed to reflect body heat. Expect some \\ncool nights, \"he says. \\n\\nThe boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than I \\ncould have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones \\nat home. These have a narrow flexible rubber sole \\nwith treads though. Good for running. \\n\\nI think I\\'m finished when Cinna pulls the gold \\nmockingj ay pin from his pocket. I had completely \\nforgotten about it. \\n\\n\"Where did you get that?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Off the green outfit you wore on the train,\" he says. I \\nremember now taking it off my mother\\'s dress, \\npinning it to the shirt. \"It\\'s your district token, right?\" \\nI nod and he fastens it on my shirt. \"It barely cleared \\nthe review board. Some thought the pin could be used \\nas a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage. But \\neventually, they let it through,\" says Cinna. \"They \\neliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. \\nIf you twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. \\nPoisoned one. She claimed she had no knowledge the \\nring transformed and there was no way to prove she \\ndid. But she lost her token. There, you\\'re all set. Move \\naround. Make sure everything feels comfortable.\" \\n\\nI walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. \"Yes, it\\'s \\nfine. Fits perfectly.\" \\n\\n\"Then there\\'s nothing to do but wait for the call,\" says \\nCinna. \"Unless you think you could eat any more?\" \\n\\nI turn down food but accept a glass of water that I \\ntake tiny sips of as we wait on a couch. I don\\'t want \\nto chew on my nails or lips, so I find myself gnawing \\non the inside of my cheek. It still hasn\\'t fully healed \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom a few days ago. Soon the taste of blood fills my \\nmouth. \\n\\nNervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is \\nto come. I could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. \\nNot even. My fingers obsessively trace the hard little \\nlump on my forearm where the woman injected the \\ntracking device. I press on it, even though it hurts, I \\npress on it so hard a small bruise begins to form. \\n\\n\"Do you want to talk, Katniss?\" Cinna asks. \\n\\nI shake my head but after a moment hold out my \\nhand to him. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And \\nthis is how we sit until a pleasant female voice \\nannounces it\\'s time to prepare for launch. \\n\\nStill clenching one of Cinna\\'s hands, I walk over and \\nstand on the circular metal plate. \"Remember what \\nHaymitch said. Run, find water. The rest will follow,\" \\nhe says. I nod. \"And remember this. I\\'m not allowed to \\nbet, but if I could, my money would be on you.\" \\n\\n\"Truly?\" I whisper. \\n\\n\"Truly,\" says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on \\nthe forehead. \"Good luck, girl on fire.\" And then a \\nglass cylinder is lowering around me, breaking our \\nhandhold, cutting him off from me. He taps his \\nfingers under his chin. Head high. \\n\\nI lift my chin and stand as straight as I can. The \\ncylinder begins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, I\\'m \\nin darkness and then I can feel the metal plate \\npushing me out of the cylinder, into the open air. For \\na moment, my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight \\nand I\\'m conscious only of a strong wind with the \\nhopeful smell of pine trees. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThen I hear the legendary announcer, Claudius \\nTemplesmith, as his voice booms all around me. \\n\\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger \\nGames begin!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSixty seconds. That\\'s how long we\\'re required to stand \\non our metal circles before the sound of a gong \\nreleases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land \\nmines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the \\nring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a \\ngiant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved \\ntail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, \\nspilling over with the things that will give us life here \\nin the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, \\nmedicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the \\nCornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing \\nthe farther they are from the horn. For instance, only \\na few steps from my feet lays a three-foot square of \\nplastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a \\ndownpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent \\npack that would protect from almost any sort of \\nweather. If I had the guts to go in and fight for it \\nagainst the other twenty- three tributes. Which I have \\nbeen instructed not to do. \\n\\nWe\\'re on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of \\nhard-packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, \\nI can see nothing, indicating either a steep downward \\nslope or even cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left \\nand back, spars piney woods. This is where Haymitch \\nwould want me to go. Immediately. \\n\\nI hear his instructions in my head. \"Just clear out, \\nput as much distance as you can between yourselves \\nand the others, and find a source of water.\" \\n\\nBut it\\'s tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty \\nwaiting there before me. And I know that if I don\\'t get \\nit, someone else will. That the Career Tributes who \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nsurvive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life- \\nsustaining spoils. Something catches my eye. There, \\nresting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath \\nof arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to \\nbe engaged. That\\'s mine, I think.It\\'s meant for me. \\n\\nI\\'m fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our \\nschool although a couple can beat me in distance \\nraces. But this forty -yard length, this is what I am \\nbuilt for. I know I can get it, I know I can reach it \\nfirst, but then the question is how quickly can I get \\nout of there? By the time I\\'ve scrambled up the packs \\nand grabbed the weapons, others will have reached \\nthe horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, \\nbut say there\\'s a dozen, at that close range, they \\ncould take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or \\ntheir own powerful fists. \\n\\nStill, I won\\'t be the only target. I\\'m betting many of \\nthe other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even \\none who scored an eleven in training, to take out their \\nmore fierce adversaries. \\n\\nHaymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had \\nhe\\'d tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that\\'s \\nthe very weapon that might be my salvation. And I \\nonly see one bow in that whole pile. I know the \\nminute must be almost up and will have to decide \\nwhat my strategy will be and I find myself positioning \\nmy feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests \\nbut toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I \\nnotice Peeta, he\\'s about five tributes to my right, quite \\na fair distance, still I can tell he\\'s looking at me and I \\nthink he might be shaking his head. But the sun\\'s in \\nmy eyes, and while I\\'m puzzling over it the gong rings \\nout. \\n\\nAnd I\\'ve missed it! I\\'ve missed my chance! Because \\nthose extra couple of seconds I\\'ve lost by not being \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nready are enough to change my mind about going in. \\nMy feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the \\ndirection my brain wants to take and then I lunge \\nforward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of \\nbread. The pickings are so small and I\\'m so angry \\nwith Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty \\nyards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could \\nhold anything because I can\\'t stand leaving with \\nvirtually nothing. \\n\\nA boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the \\nsame time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it \\nand then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I \\nstagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. \\nThen the boy slips to the ground. That\\'s when I see \\nthe knife in his back. Already other tributes have \\nreached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to \\nattack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, \\nrunning toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen \\nknives. I\\'ve seen her throw in training. She never \\nmisses. And I\\'m her next target. \\n\\nAll the general fear I\\'ve been feeling condenses into at \\nimmediate fear of this girl, this predator who might \\nkill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and \\nI sling the pack over one shoulder and run full- speed \\nfor the woods. I can hear the blade whistling toward \\nme and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my \\nhead. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on \\nmy shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I \\nknow the girl will not pursue me. That she\\'ll be drawn \\nback into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is \\ngone. A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I \\nthink. \\n\\nAt the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to \\nsurvey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are \\nhacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie \\ndead already on the ground. Those who have taken \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nflight are disappearing into the trees or into the void \\nopposite me. I continue running until the woods have \\nhidden me from the other tributes then slow into a \\nsteady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For \\nthe next few hours, I alternate between jogging and \\nwalking, putting as much distance as I can between \\nmyself and my competitors. I lost my bread during \\nthe struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed \\nto stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it \\nneatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated \\nnear the handle, which will make it handy for sawing \\nthrough things \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and slide it into my belt. I don\\'t \\ndare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. I \\njust keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers. \\n\\nI can go a long time. I know that from my days in the \\nwoods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch\\'s \\nsecond instruction, and since I sort of botched the \\nfirst, I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck. \\n\\nThe woods begin to evolve, and the pines are \\nintermixed with a variety of trees, some I recognize, \\nsome completely foreign to me. At one point, I hear a \\nnoise and pull my knife, thinking I may have to \\ndefend myself, but I\\'ve only startled a rabbit. \"Good to \\nsee you,\" I whisper. If there\\'s one rabbit, there could \\nbe hundreds just waiting to be snared. \\n\\nThe ground slopes down. I don\\'t particularly like this. \\nValleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like \\nin the hills around District 12, where I can see my \\nenemies approaching. But I have no choice but to \\nkeep going. \\n\\nFunny though, I don\\'t feel too bad. The days of \\ngorging myself have paid off. I\\'ve got staying power \\neven though I\\'m short on sleep. Being in the woods is \\nrejuvenating. I\\'m glad for the solitude, even though \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nit\\'s an illusion, because I\\'m probably on-screen right \\nnow. Not consistently but off and on. There are so \\nmany deaths to show the first day that a tribute \\ntrekking through the woods isn\\'t much to look at. But \\nthey 11 show me enough to let people know I\\'m alive, \\nuninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days \\nof betting is the opening, when the initial casualties \\ncome in. But that can\\'t compare to what happens as \\nthe field shrinks to a handful of players. \\n\\nIt\\'s late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. \\nEach shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting \\nmust have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They \\nnever collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers \\nhave dispersed. On the opening day, they don\\'t even \\nfire the cannons until the initial fighting\\'s over \\nbecause it\\'s too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I \\nallow myself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. \\nOne . . . two . . . three ... on and on until they reach \\neleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My \\nfingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from \\nDistrict 9 coughed into my face. He\\'s gone, certainly. I \\nwonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? \\nI\\'ll know in a few hours. When they project the dead\\'s \\nimages into the sky for the rest of us to see. \\n\\nAll of a sudden, I\\'m overwhelmed by the thought that \\nPeeta may be already lost, bled white, collected, and \\nin the process of being transported back to the \\nCapitol to be cleaned up, redressed, and shipped in a \\nsimple wooden box back to District 12. No longer \\nhere. Heading home. I try hard to remember if I saw \\nhim once the action started. But the last image I can \\nconjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang \\nout. \\n\\nMaybe it\\'s better, if he\\'s gone already. He had no \\nconfidence he could win. And I will not end up with \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthe unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe it\\'s better if \\nhe\\'s out of this for good. \\n\\nI slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to \\ngo through it anyway before night falls. See what I \\nhave to work with. As I unhook the straps, I can feel \\nit\\'s sturdily made although a rather unfortunate \\ncolor. This orange will practically glow in the dark. I \\nmake a mental note to camouflage it first thing \\ntomorrow. \\n\\nI flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this \\nmoment, is water. Haymitch\\'s directive to immediately \\nfind water was not arbitrary. I won\\'t last long without \\nit. For a few days, 111 be able to function with \\nunpleasant symptomsof dehydration, but after that \\nI\\'ll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a \\nweek, tops. I carefully lay out the provisions. One thin \\nblack sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of \\ncrackers. A pack of dried beef strips. A bottle of \\niodine. A box of wooden matches. A small coil of wire. \\nA pair of sunglasses. And a half-gallon plastic bottle \\nwith a cap for carrying water that\\'s bone dry. \\n\\nNo water. How hard would it have been for them to fill \\nup the bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my \\nthroat and mouth, the cracks in my lips. I\\'ve been \\nmoving all day long. It\\'s been hot and I\\'ve sweat a lot. \\nI do this at home, but there are always streams to \\ndrink from, or snow to melt if it should come to it. \\n\\nAs I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. \\nThe one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to \\nsound. What if that\\'s the only water source in the \\narena? That way they\\'ll guarantee drawing us in to \\nfight. The lake is a full day\\'s journey from where I sit \\nnow, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. \\nAnd then, even if I reach it, it\\'s sure to be heavily \\nguarded by some of the Career Tributes. I\\'m about to \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\npanic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier \\ntoday. It has to drink, too. I just have to find out \\nwhere. \\n\\nTwilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees \\nare too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of \\npine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes \\ntracking animals harder when I need their trails to \\nfind water. And I\\'m still heading downhill, deeper and \\ndeeper into a valley that seems endless. \\n\\nI\\'m hungry, too, but I don\\'t dare break into my \\nprecious store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take \\nmy knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away \\nthe outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the \\nsofter inner bark. I slowly chew the stuff as I walk \\nalong. After a week of the finest food in the world, it\\'s \\na little hard to choke down. But I\\'ve eaten plenty of \\npine in my life. Ill adjust quickly. \\n\\nIn another hour, it\\'s clear I\\'ve got to find a place to \\ncamp. Night creatures are coming out. I can hear the \\noccasional hoot or howl, my first clue that 111 be \\ncompeting with natural predators for the rabbits. As \\nto whether 111 be viewed as a source of food, it\\'s too \\nsoon to tell. There could be any number of animals \\nstalking me at this moment. \\n\\nBut right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a \\npriority. I\\'m sure many will continue hunting through \\nthe night. Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia \\nwill have food, an abundance of water from the lake, \\ntorches or flashlights, and weapons they\\'re itching to \\nuse. I can only hope I\\'ve traveled far and fast enough \\nto be out of range. \\n\\nBefore settling down, I take my wire and set two \\ntwitch-up snares in the brush. I know it\\'s risky to be \\nsetting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And I \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ncan\\'t set snares on the run. Still, I walk another five \\nminutes before making camp. \\n\\nI pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but \\nset in a clump of other willows, offering concealment \\nin those long, flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to \\nthe stronger branches close to the trunk, and find a \\nsturdy fork for my bed. It takes some doing, but I \\narrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable \\nmanner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, \\nthen slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my \\nbelt, loop it all the way around the branch and my \\nsleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if I roll \\nover in my sleep, I won\\'t go crashing to the ground. \\nI\\'m small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my \\nhead, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, the \\nair is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting \\nthe backpack, I know now it was the right choice. \\nThis sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my \\nbody heat, will be invaluable. I\\'m sure there are \\nseveral other tributes whose biggest concern right \\nnow is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be \\nable to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn\\'t so \\nthirsty ... \\n\\nNight has just come when I hear the anthem that \\nproceeds the death recap. Through the branches I can \\nsee the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be \\nfloating in the sky. I\\'m actually viewing another \\nscreen, an enormous one that\\'s transported by of one \\nof their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades \\nout and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we \\nwould be watching full coverage of each and every \\nkilling, but that\\'s thought to give an unfair advantage \\nto the living tributes. For instance, if I got my hands \\non the bow and shot someone, my secret would be \\nrevealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are \\nthe same photographs they showed when they \\ntelevised our training scores. Simple head shots. But \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nnow instead of scores they post only district numbers. \\nI take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead \\ntributes begin and tick them off one by one on my \\nfingers. \\n\\nThe first to appear is the girl from District 3. That \\nmeans that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all \\nsurvived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I \\ndidn\\'t expect that one, usually all the Careers make it \\nthrough the first day. The boy from District 5 ... I \\nguess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 \\nand 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there\\'s the \\nboy who I fought for the backpack. I\\'ve run through \\nmy fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it \\nPeeta? No, there\\'s the girl from District 10. That\\'s it. \\nThe Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. \\nThen darkness and the sounds of the forest resume. \\n\\nI\\'m relieved Peeta\\'s alive. I tell myself again that if I \\nget killed, his winning will benefit my mother and \\nPrim the most. This is what I tell myself to explain the \\nconflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta. \\nThe gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing \\nhis love for me in the interview. The anger at his \\nsuperiority on the roof. The dread that we may come \\nface-to-face at any moment in this arena. \\n\\nEleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work \\nout who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh \\nand Rue. Rue ... so she made it through the first day \\nafter all. I can\\'t help feeling glad. That makes ten of \\nus. The other three I\\'ll figure out tomorrow. Now when \\nit is dark, and I have traveled far, and I am nestled \\nhigh in this tree, now I must try and rest. \\n\\nI haven\\'t really slept in two days, and then there\\'s \\nbeen the long day\\'s journey into the arena. Slowly, I \\nallow my muscles to relax. My eyes to close. The last \\nthing I think is it\\'s lucky I don\\'t snore... . \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nSnap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. \\nHow long have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The \\ntip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! What\\'s going \\non? This is not the sound of a branch under \\nsomeone\\'s foot, but the sharp crack of one coming \\nfrom a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several \\nhundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn \\nmyself in that direction. For a few minutes, there\\'s \\nnothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then I see \\na spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of \\nhands warms over flames, but I can\\'t make out more \\nthan that. \\n\\nI have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I \\nknow at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A \\nfire 111 just at nightfall would have been one thing. \\nThose who battled at the Cornucopia, with their \\nsuperior strength and surplus of supplies, they \\ncouldn\\'t possibly have been near enough to spot the \\nflames then. But now, when they\\'ve probably been \\ncombing the woods for hours looking for victims. You \\nmight as well be waving a flag and shouting, \"Come \\nand get me!\" \\n\\nAnd here I am a stone\\'s throw from the biggest idiot \\nin the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee \\nsince my general location has just been broadcast to \\nany killer who cares. I mean, I know it\\'s cold out here \\nand not everybody has a sleeping bag. But then you \\ngrit your teeth and stick it out until dawn! \\n\\nI lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of \\nhours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I \\nwon\\'t have the least problem taking out my new \\nneighbor. My instinct has been to flee, not fight. But \\nobviously this person\\'s a hazard. Stupid people are \\ndangerous. And this one probably doesn\\'t have much \\nin the way of weapons while I\\'ve got this excellent \\nknife. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of \\ndawn approaching. I\\'m beginning to think we \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\nmeaning the person whose death I\\'m now devising \\nand me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we might actually have gone unnoticed. \\nThen I hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a \\nrun. The fire starter must have dozed off. They\\'re on \\nher before she can escape. I know it\\'s a girl now, I can \\ntell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. \\nThen there\\'s laughter and congratulations from \\nseveral voices. Someone cries out, \"Twelve down and \\neleven to go!\" which gets a round of appreciative \\nhoots. \\n\\nSo they\\'re fighting in a pack. I\\'m not really surprised. \\nOften alliances are formed in the early stages of the \\nGames. The strong band together to hunt down the \\nweak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin \\nto turn on one another. I don\\'t have to wonder too \\nhard who has made this alliance. It 11 be the \\nremaining Career Tributes from Districts 1,2, and 4. \\nTwo boys and three girls. The ones who lunched \\ntogether. \\n\\nFor a moment, I hear them checking the girl for \\nsupplies. I can tell by their comments they\\'ve found \\nnothing good. I wonder if the victim is Rue but \\nquickly dismiss the thought. She\\'s much too bright to \\nbe building a fire like that. \\n\\n\"Better clear out so they can get the body before it \\nstarts stinking.\" I\\'m almost certain that\\'s the brutish \\nboy from District 2. There are murmurs of assent and \\nthen, to my horror, I hear the pack heading toward \\nme. They do not know I\\'m here. How could they? And \\nI\\'m well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while \\nthe sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag will \\nturn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep \\nmoving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBut the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards \\nfrom my tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see \\nan arm here, a boot there, through the breaks in the \\nbranches. I turn to stone, not even daring to breathe. \\nHave they spotted me? No, not yet. I can tell from \\ntheir words their minds are elsewhere. \\n\\n\"Shouldn\\'t we have heard a cannon by now?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'d say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in \\nimmediately.\" \\n\\n\"Unless she isn\\'t dead.\" \\n\\n\"She\\'s dead. I stuck her myself.\" \\n\\n\"Then where \\'s the cannon?\" \\n\\n\"Someone should go back. Make sure the job\\'s done.\" \\n\\n\"Yeah, we don\\'t want to have to track her down \\ntwice.\" \\n\\n\"I said she\\'s dead!\" \\n\\nAn argument breaks out until one tribute silences the \\nothers. \"We\\'re wasting time! Ill go finish her and let\\'s \\nmove on!\" \\n\\nI almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. \\nI\\'ve rolled sideways off the fork and I\\'m facing the \\nground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my \\nfeet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, \\nbraced against the trunk. There must have been some \\nrustling when I tipped sideways, but the Careers have \\nbeen too caught up in their own argument to catch it. \\n\\n\"Go on, then, Lover Boy,\" says the boy from District \\n2. \"See for yourself.\" \\n\\nI just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading \\nback to the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with \\nbruises, there\\'s a bloody bandage on one arm, and \\nfrom the sound of his gait he\\'s limping somewhat. I \\nremember him shaking him his head, telling me not \\nto go into the fight for the supplies, when all along, all \\nalong he\\'d planned to throw himself into the thick of \\nthings. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid \\nhim to do. \\n\\nOkay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies \\nwas tempting. But this . . . this other thing. This \\nteaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down \\nthe rest of us. No one from District 12 would think of \\ndoing such a thing! Career tributes are overly vicious, \\narrogant, better fed, but only because they\\'re the \\nCapitol\\'s lapdogs. \\n\\nUniversally, solidly hated by all but those from their \\nown districts. I can imagine the things they\\'re saying \\nabout him back home now. And Peeta had the gall to \\ntalk to me about disgrace? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nObviously, the noble boy on the rooftop was playing \\njust one more game with me. But this will be his last. \\nI will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his \\ndeath, if I don\\'t kill him first myself. \\n\\nThe Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear \\nshot, then use hushed voices. \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t we just kill him now and get it over with?\" \\n\\n\"Let him tag along. What\\'s the harm? And he\\'s handy \\nwith that knife.\" \\n\\nIs he? That\\'s news. What a lot of interesting things \\nI\\'m learning about my friend Peeta today. \\n\\n\"Besides, he\\'s our best chance of finding her.\" \\n\\nIt takes me a moment to register that the \"her\" they\\'re \\nreferring to is me. \\n\\n\"Why? You think she bought into that sappy romance \\nstuff?\" \\n\\n\"She might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. \\nEvery time I think about her spinning around in that \\ndress, I want to puke.\" \\n\\n\"Wish we knew how she got that eleven.\" \\n\\n\"Bet you Lover Boy knows.\" \\n\\nThe sound of Peeta returning silences them. \\n\\n\"Was she dead?\" asks the boy from District 2. \\n\\n\"No. But she is now,\" says Peeta. Just then, the \\ncannon fires. \"Ready to move on?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins \\nto break, and birdsong fills the air. I remain in my \\nawkward position, muscles trembling with exertion \\nfor a while longer, then hoist myself back onto my \\nbranch. I need to get down, to get going, but for a \\nmoment I lie there, digesting what I\\'ve heard. Not only \\nis Peeta with the Careers, he\\'s helping them find me. \\nThe simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously \\nbecause of her eleven. Because she can use a bow \\nand arrow. Which Peeta knows better than anyone. \\n\\nBut he hasn\\'t told them yet. Is he saving that \\ninformation because he knows it\\'s all that keeps him \\nalive? Is he still pretending to love me for the \\naudience? What is going on in his head? \\n\\nSuddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a high- \\npitched warning call. A single note. Just like the one \\nGale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was \\ncaught. High above the dying campfire a hovercraft \\nmaterializes. A set of huge metal teeth drops down. \\nSlowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the \\nhovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume their \\nsong. \\n\\n\"Move,\" I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my \\nsleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take \\na deep breath. While I\\'ve been concealed by darkness \\nand the sleeping bag and the willow branches, it has \\nprobably been difficult for the cameras to get a good \\nshot of me. I know they must be tracking me now \\nthough. The minute I hit the ground, I\\'m guaranteed \\na close-up. \\n\\nThe audience will have been beside themselves, \\nknowing I was in the tree, that I overheard the \\nCareers talking, that I discovered Peeta was with \\nthem. Until I work out exactly how I want to play that, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. \\nCertainly not confused or frightened. \\n\\nNo, I need to look one step ahead of the game. \\n\\nSo as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, \\nI pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on \\nme. Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give \\na knowing smile. There! Let them figure out what that \\nmeans! \\n\\nI\\'m about to take off when I think of my snares. \\nMaybe it\\'s imprudent to check them with the others \\nso close. But have to. Too many years of hunting, I \\nguess. And the lure of possible meat. I\\'m rewarded \\nwith one fine rabbit. In no time, I\\'ve cleaned and \\ngutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, \\nand innards, under a pile of leaves. I\\'m wishing for a \\nfire \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a \\nlesson I learned the hard way \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when I think of the \\ndead tribute. I hurry back to her camp. Sure enough, \\nthe coals of her dying fire are still hot. I cut up the \\nrabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over \\nthe coals. \\n\\nI\\'m glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I \\ncan hunt, that I\\'m a good bet because I won\\'t be lured \\ninto traps as easily as the others will by hunger. \\nWhile the rabbit cooks, I grind up part of a charred \\nbranch and set about camouflaging my orange pack. \\nThe black tones it down, but I feel a layer of mud \\nwould definitely help. Of course, to have mud, I\\'d \\nneed water . . . \\n\\nI pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over \\nthe coals, and take off in the opposite direction the \\nCareers went. I eat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap \\nup the leftovers in my plastic for later. The meat stops \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthe grumbling in my stomach but does little to \\nquench my thirst. Water is my top priority now. \\n\\nAs I hike along, I feel certain I\\'m still holding the \\nscreen in the Capitol, so I\\'m careful to continue to \\nhide my emotions. But what a good time Claudius \\nTemplesmith must be having with his guest \\ncommentators, dissecting Peeta\\'s behavior, my \\nreaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed \\nhis true colors? How does this affect the betting odds? \\nWill we lose sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? \\nYes, I feel certain we do, or at least did. \\n\\nCertainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star- \\ncrossed lover dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he \\nhasn\\'t spoken much about me, we can still get some \\nmileage out of it. Maybe people will think it\\'s \\nsomething we plotted together if I seem like it amuses \\nme now. \\n\\nThe sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy \\nit seems overly bright. I coat my lips in some grease \\nfrom the rabbit and try to keep from panting, but it\\'s \\nno use. It\\'s only been a day and I\\'m dehydrating fast. \\nI try and think of everything I know about finding \\nwater. It runs downhill, so, in fact, continuing down \\ninto this valley isn\\'t a bad thing. If I could just locate \\na game trail or spot a particularly green patch of \\nvegetation, these might help me along, but nothing \\nseems to change. There\\'s just the slight gradual slope, \\nthe birds, the sameness to the trees. \\n\\nAs the day wears on, I know I\\'m headed for trouble. \\nWhat little urine I\\'ve been able to pass is a dark \\nbrown, my head is aching, and there\\'s a dry patch on \\nmy tongue that refuses to moisten. The sun hurts my \\neyes so I dig out my sunglasses, but when I put them \\non they do something funny to my vision, so I just \\nstuff them back in my pack. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s late afternoon when I think I\\'ve found help. I spot \\na cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, \\nto suck the sweet juices from the skins. But just as \\nI\\'m holding them to my lips, I get a hard look at them. \\nWhat I thought were blueberries have a slightly \\ndifferent shape, and when I break one open the \\ninsides are bloodred. I don\\'t recognize these berries, \\nperhaps they are edible, but I\\'m guessing this is some \\nevil trick on the part of the Gamemakers. Even the \\nplant instructor in the Training Center made a point \\nof telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 \\npercent sure they weren\\'t toxic. Something I already \\nknew, but I\\'m so thirsty it takes her reminder to give \\nme the strength to fling them away. \\n\\nFatigue is beginning to settle on me, but it\\'s not the \\nusual tiredness that follows a long hike. I have to stop \\nand rest frequently, although I know the only cure for \\nwhat ails me requires continued searching. I try a \\nnew tactic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 climbing a tree as high as I dare in my \\nshaky state \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to look for any signs of water. But as \\nfar as I can see in any direction, there\\'s the same \\nunrelenting stretch of forest. \\n\\nDetermined to go on until nightfall, I walk until I\\'m \\nstumbling over my own feet. \\n\\nExhausted, I haul myself up into a tree and belt \\nmyself in. I\\'ve no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone \\njust to give my mouth something to do. Night falls, \\nthe anthem plays, and high in the sky I see the \\npicture of the girl, who was apparently from District \\n8. The one Peeta went back to finish off. \\n\\nMy fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my \\nburning thirst. Besides, they were heading away from \\nme and by now they, too, will have to rest. With the \\nscarcity of water, they may even have had to return to \\nthe lake for refills. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe, that is the only course for me as well. \\n\\n\\n\\nMorning brings distress. My heads throbs with every \\nbeat of my heart. Simple movements send stabs of \\npain through my joints. I fall, rather than jump from \\nthe tree. It takes several minutes for me to assemble \\nmy gear. Somewhere inside me, I know this is wrong. \\nI should be acting with more caution, moving with \\nmore urgency. But my mind seems foggy and forming \\na plan is hard. I lean back against the trunk of my \\ntree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper \\nsurface of my tongue, as I assess my options. How \\ncan I get water? \\n\\nReturn to the lake. No good. I\\'d never make it. \\n\\nHope for rain. There\\'s not a cloud in the sky. \\n\\nKeep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, \\nanother thought hits me, and the surge of anger that \\nfollows brings me to me senses. \\n\\nHaymitch! He could send me water! Press a button \\nand have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in \\nminutes. I know I must have sponsors, at least one or \\ntwo who could afford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, it\\'s \\npricey, but these people, they\\'re made of money. And \\nthey\\'ll be betting on me as well. Perhaps Haymitch \\ndoesn\\'t realize how deep my need is. \\n\\nI say in a voice as loud as I dare. \"Water.\" I wait, \\nhopefully, for a parachute to descend from the sky. \\nBut nothing is forthcoming. \\n\\nSomething is wrong. Am I deluded about having \\nsponsors? Or has Peeta\\'s behavior made them all \\nhang back? No, I don\\'t believe it. There\\'s someone out \\nthere who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is \\nrefusing to let it go through. As my mentor, he gets to \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ncontrol the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I know he \\nhates me. He\\'s made that clear enough. But enough \\nto let me die? From this? He can\\'t do that, can he? If \\na mentor mistreats his tributes, hell be held \\naccountable by the viewers, by the people back in \\nDistrict 12. Even Haymitch wouldn\\'t risk that, would \\nhe? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the \\nHob, but I don\\'t think they\\'d welcome him back there \\nif he let me die this way. And then where would he get \\nhis liquor? So . . . what? Is he trying to make me suffer \\nfor defying him? Is he directing all the sponsors \\ntoward Peeta? Is he just too drunk to even notice \\nwhat\\'s going on at the moment? Somehow I don\\'t \\nbelieve that and I don\\'t believe he\\'s trying to kill me \\noff by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own \\nunpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me \\nfor this. Then what is going on? \\n\\nI bury my face in my hands. There\\'s no danger of \\ntears now, I couldn\\'t produce one to save my life. \\nWhat is Haymitch doing? Despite my anger, hatred, \\nand suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head \\nwhispers an answer. \\n\\nMaybe he\\'s sending you a message, it says. A \\nmessage. Saying what? Then I know. There\\'s only one \\ngood reason Haymitch could be withholding water \\nfrom me. Because he knows I\\'ve almost found it. \\n\\nI grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My \\nbackpack seems to have tripled in weight. I find a \\nbroken branch that will do for a walking stick and I \\nstart off. The sun\\'s beating down, even more searing \\nthan the first two days. I feel like an old piece of \\nleather, drying and cracking in the heat, every step is \\nan effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I \\nsit, there\\'s a good chance I won\\'t be able to get up \\nagain, that I won\\'t even remember my task. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, \\ncould take me right now, merely shove me over and \\nkill me with my own knife, and I\\'d have little strength \\nto resist. But if anyone is in my part of the woods, \\nthey ignore me. The truth is, I feel a million miles \\nfrom another living soul. \\n\\nNot alone though. No, they\\'ve surely got a camera \\ntracking me now. I think back to the years of \\nwatching tributes starve, freeze, bleed, and dehydrate \\nto death. Unless there\\'s a really good fight going on \\nsomewhere, I\\'m being featured. \\n\\nMy thoughts turn to Prim. It\\'s likely she won\\'t be \\nwatching me live, but theyll show updates at the \\nschool during lunch. For her sake, I try to look as \\nleast desperate as I can. \\n\\nBut by afternoon, I know the end is coming. My legs \\nare shaking and my heart too quick. I keep forgetting, \\nexactly what I\\'m doing. I\\'ve stumbled repeatedly and \\nmanaged to regain my feet, but when the stick slides \\nout from under me, I finally tumble to the ground \\nunable to get up. I let my eyes close. \\n\\nI have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of \\nhelping me at all. \\n\\nThis is all right, I think. This is not so bad here. The \\nair is less hot, signifying evening\\'s approach. There\\'s \\na slight, sweet scent that reminds me of lilies. My \\nfingers stroke the smooth ground, sliding easily \\nacross the top. This is an okay place to die, I think. \\n\\nMy fingertips make small swirling patterns in the \\ncool, slippery earth, ilove mud, I think. How many \\ntimes I\\'ve tracked game with the help of its soft, \\nreadable surface. Good for bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. \\nMud! My eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nearth. It is mud! My nose lifts in the air. And those \\nare lilies! Pond lilies! \\n\\nI crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself \\ntoward the scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl \\nthrough a tangle of plants into a pond. Floating on \\nthe top, yellow flowers in bloom, are my beautiful \\nlilies. \\n\\nIt\\'s all I can do not to plunge my face into the water \\nand gulp down as much as I can hold. But I have jus \\nenough sense left to abstain. With trembling hands, I \\nget out my flask and fill it with water. I add what I \\nremember to be the right number of drops of iodine \\nfor purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is agony, \\nbut I do it. At least, \\n\\nI think it\\'s a half an hour, but it\\'s certainly as long as \\nI can stand. \\n\\nSlowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and \\nmake myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple \\nof hours, I drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. \\nI prepare another before I retire to a tree where I \\ncontinue sipping, eating rabbit, and even indulge in \\none of my precious crackers. By the time the anthem \\nplays, I feel remarkably better. There are no faces \\ntonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow 111 stay \\nhere, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, \\ncatching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped, \\ndigging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice \\nmeal. I snuggle down in my sleeping bag, hanging on \\nto my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is. \\n\\nA few hours later, the stampede of feet shakes me \\nfrom slumber. I look around in bewilderment. It\\'s not \\nyet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIt would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on \\nme. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMy first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I\\'m \\nbelted in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the \\nbuckle and I fall to the ground in a heap, still snarled \\nin my sleeping bag. There\\'s no time for any kind of \\npacking. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle \\nare already in the bag. I shove in the belt, hoist the \\nbag over my shoulder, and flee. \\n\\nThe world has transformed to flame and smoke. \\nBurning branches crack from trees and fall in \\nshowers of sparks at my feet. All I can do is follow the \\nothers, the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild \\ndog pack shooting through the woods. I trust their \\nsense of direction because their instincts are sharper \\nthan mine. But they are much faster, flying through \\nthe underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on \\nroots and fallen tree limbs, that there\\'s no way I can \\nkeep apace with them. \\n\\nThe heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the \\nsmoke, which threatens to suffocate me at any \\nmoment. I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose, \\ngrateful to find it soaked in sweat, and it offers a thin \\nveil of protection. And I run, choking, my bag banging \\nagainst my back, my face cut with branches that \\nmaterialize from the gray haze without warning, \\nbecause I know I am supposed to run. \\n\\nThis was no tribute\\'s campfire gone out of control, no \\naccidental occurrence. The flames that bear down on \\nme have an unnatural height, a uniformity that \\nmarks them as human-made, machine-made, \\nGamemaker-made. Things have been too quiet today. \\nNo deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in \\nthe Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nGames are verging on dullness. This is the one thing \\nthe Games must not do. \\n\\nIt\\'s not hard to follow the Gamemakers\\' motivation. \\nThere is the Career pack and then there are the rest \\nof us, probably spread far and thin across the arena. \\nThis fire is designed to flush us out, to drive us \\ntogether. It may not be the most original device I\\'ve \\nseen, but it\\'s very, very effective. \\n\\nI hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail \\nend of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to \\nrip it from my body and stamp out the flames. But I \\ndon\\'t dare leave the jacket, scorched and smoldering \\nas it is, I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping \\nbag, hoping the lack of air will quell what I haven\\'t \\nextinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my \\nback, and it\\'s little enough to survive with. \\n\\nIn a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are \\nburning. The coughing begins soon after and my \\nlungs begin to feel as if they are actually being \\ncooked. Discomfort turns to distress until each breath \\nsends a searing pain through my chest. I manage to \\ntake cover under a stone outcropping just as the \\nvomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and \\nwhatever water has remained in my stomach. \\nCrouching on my hands and knees, I retch until \\nthere\\'s nothing left to come up. \\n\\nI know I need to keep moving, but I\\'m trembling and \\nlight-headed now, gasping for air. I allow myself about \\na spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then \\ntake a few swallows from my bottle. You get one \\nminute, I tell myself. One minute to rest. I take the \\ntime to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping bag, \\nand messily stuff everything into the backpack. My \\nminute\\'s up. I know it\\'s time to move on, but the \\nsmoke has clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nanimals that were my compass have left me behind. I \\nknow I haven\\'t been in this part of the woods before, \\nthere were no sizable rocks like the one I\\'m sheltering \\nagainst on my earlier travels. Where are the \\nGamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a \\nwhole new terrain filled with new dangers? I had just \\nfound a few hours of peace at the pond when this \\nattack began. Would there be any way I could travel \\nparallel to the fire and work my way back there, to a \\nsource of water at least? The wall of fire must have an \\nend and it won\\'t burn indefinitely. Not because the \\nGamemakers couldn\\'t keep it fueled but because, \\nagain, that would invite accusations of boredom from \\nthe audience. If I could get back behind the fire line, I \\ncould avoid meeting up with the Careers. I\\'ve just \\ndecided to try and loop back around, although it will \\nrequire miles of travel away from the inferno and then \\na very circuitous route back, when the first fireball \\nblasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I \\nspring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed \\nfear. \\n\\nThe game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get \\nus moving, now the audience will get to see some real \\nfun. When I hear the next hiss, I flatten on the \\nground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a \\ntree off to my left, engulfing it in flames. To remain \\nstill is death. I\\'m barely on my feet before the third \\nball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a \\npillar of fire up behind me. Time loses meaning now \\nas I frantically try to dodge the attacks. I can\\'t see \\nwhere they\\'re being launched from, but it\\'s not a \\nhovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough. \\nProbably this whole segment of the woods has been \\narmed with precision launchers that are concealed in \\ntrees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless \\nroom, a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers \\non the triggers that could end my life in a second. All \\nthat is needed is a direct hit. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever vague plan I had conceived regarding \\nreturning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I \\nzigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs. Each \\none is only the size of an apple, but packs \\ntremendous power on contact. Every sense I have \\ngoes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. \\nThere\\'s no time to judge if a move is the correct one. \\nWhen there\\'s a hiss, I act or die. \\n\\nSomething keeps me moving forward, though. A \\nlifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know \\nthat certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain \\nattacks. And that if I can just get away from this \\nsection, I might be able to move out of reach of the \\nlaunchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit of \\nvipers, but I can\\'t worry about that now. \\n\\nHow long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I can\\'t \\nsay, but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is \\ngood, because I\\'m retching again. This time it\\'s an \\nacidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its \\nway into my nose as well. I\\'m forced to stop as my \\nbody convulses, trying desperately to rid itself of the \\npoisons I\\'ve been sucking in during the attack. I wait \\nfor the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn\\'t \\ncome. The force of the retching has squeezed tears \\nout of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in \\nsweat. Somehow, through the smoke and vomit, I \\npick up the scent of singed hair. My hand fumbles to \\nmy braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least \\nsix inches of it. Strands of blackened hair crumble in \\nmy fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the \\ntransformation, when the hissing registers. \\n\\nMy muscles react, only not fast enough this time. The \\nfireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not \\nbefore it skids across my right calf. Seeing my pants \\nleg on fire sends me over the edge. I twist and scuttle \\nbackward on my hands and feet, shrieking, trying to \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nremove myself from the horror. When I finally regain \\nenough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the \\nground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, \\nwithout thinking, I rip away the remaining fabric with \\nmy bare hands. \\n\\nI sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze set off \\nby the fireball. My calf is screaming, my hands \\ncovered in red welts. I\\'m shaking too hard to move. If \\nthe Gamemakers want to finish me off, now is the \\ntime. \\n\\nI hear Cinna\\'s voice, carrying images of rich fabric \\nand sparkling gems. \"Katniss, the girl who was on \\nfire.\" What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be \\nhaving over that one. Perhaps, Cinna\\'s beautiful \\ncostumes have even brought on this particular \\ntorture for me. I know he couldn\\'t have foreseen this, \\nmust be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he \\ncares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up \\nstark naked in that chariot would have been safer for \\nme. \\n\\nThe attack is now over. The Gamemakers don\\'t want \\nme dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could \\ndestroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The \\nreal sport of the Hunger Games is watching the \\ntributes kill one another. Every so often, they do kill a \\ntribute just to remind the players they can. But \\nmostly, they manipulate us into confronting one \\nanother face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer \\nbeing fired at, there is at least one other tribute close \\nat hand. \\n\\nI would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I \\ncould, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I \\nmake myself stand and begin to limp away from the \\nwall of flames that lights up the sky. It does not seem \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nto be pursuing me any longer, except with its stinking \\nblack clouds. \\n\\nAnother light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls \\nof smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I \\ncan see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute \\ncould easily be concealed from me here. I should draw \\nmy knife as a precaution, but I doubt my ability to \\nhold it for long. The pain in my hands can in no way \\ncompete with that in my calf. I hate burns, have \\nalways hated them, even a small one gotten from \\npulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst \\nkind of pain to me, but I have never experienced \\nanything like this. \\n\\nI\\'m so weary I don\\'t even notice I\\'m in the pool until \\nI\\'m ankle-deep. It\\'s spring-fed, bubbling up out of a \\ncrevice in some rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my \\nhands into the shallow water and feel instant relief. \\nIsn\\'t that what my mother always says? The first \\ntreatment for a burn is cold water? That it draws out \\nthe heat? But she means minor burns. Probably she\\'d \\nrecommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? \\nAlthough I have not yet had the courage to examine \\nit, I\\'m guessing that it\\'s an injury in a whole different \\nclass. \\n\\nI lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while, \\ndangling my hands in the water, examining the little \\nflames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip \\noff. Good. I\\'ve had enough fire for a lifetime. \\n\\nI bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall \\nall I know about burns. They are common injuries in \\nthe Seam where we cook and heat our homes with \\ncoal. Then there are the mine accidents... . A family \\nonce brought in an unconscious young man pleading \\nwith my mother to help him. The district doctor who\\'s \\nresponsible for treating the miners had written him \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\noff, told the family to take him home to die. But they \\nwouldn\\'t accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, \\nsenseless to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound \\non his thigh, gaping, charred flesh, burned clear \\ndown to the bone, before I ran from the house. I went \\nto the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted by \\nthe gruesome leg, memories of my father\\'s death. \\nWhat\\'s funny was, Prim, who\\'s scared of her own \\nshadow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers \\nare born, not made. They did their best, but the man \\ndied, just like the doctor said he would. \\n\\nMy leg is in need of attention, but I still can\\'t look at \\nit. What if it\\'s as bad as the man\\'s and I can see my \\nbone? Then I remember my mother saying that if a \\nburn\\'s severe, the victim might not even feel pain \\nbecause the nerves would be destroyed. Encouraged \\nby this, I sit up and swing my leg in front of me. \\n\\nI almost faint at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a \\nbrilliant red covered with blisters. I force myself to \\ntake deep, slow breaths, feeling quite certain the \\ncameras are on my face. I can\\'t show weakness at this \\ninjury. Not if I want help. Pity does not get you aid. \\nAdmiration at your refusal to give in does. I cut the \\nremains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine \\nthe injury more closely. The burned area is about the \\nsize of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I \\nthink it\\'s not too bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out \\nmy leg into the pool, propping the heel of my boot on \\na rock so the leather doesn\\'t get too sodden, and sigh, \\nbecause this does offer some relief. I know there are \\nherbs, if I could find them, that would speed the \\nhealing, but I can\\'t quite call them to mind. Water \\nand time will probably be all I have to work with. \\n\\nShould I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing \\nbut still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away \\nfrom the fire, won\\'t I be walking straight into the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nweapons of the Careers? Besides, every time I lift my \\nleg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely I \\nhave to slide it back in. My hands are slightly less \\ndemanding. They can handle small breaks from the \\npool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill \\nmy bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when \\nenough time has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. \\nAfter a time, I force myself to nibble on a cracker, \\nwhich helps settle my stomach. I roll up my sleeping \\nbag. Except for a few black marks, it\\'s relatively \\nunscathed. My jacket\\'s another matter. Stinking and \\nscorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair. I \\ncut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment \\nthat comes just to the bottom of my ribs. But the \\nhood\\'s intact and it\\'s far better than nothing. \\n\\nDespite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I\\'d \\ntake to a tree and try to rest, except I\\'d be too easy to \\nspot. Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. \\nI neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on \\nmy shoulders, but I can\\'t seem to leave. I spot some \\nwater plants with edible roots and make a small meal \\nwith my last piece of rabbit. Sip water. Watch the sun \\nmake its slow arc across the sky. Where would I go \\nanyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on \\nmy pack, overcome by drowsiness. If the Careers \\nwant me, let them find me, I think before drifting into \\na stupor. Let them find me. \\n\\nAnd find me, they do. It\\'s lucky I\\'m ready to move on \\nbecause when I hear the feet, I have less than a \\nminute head start. Evening has begun to fall. The \\nmoment I awake, I\\'m up and running, splashing \\nacross the pool, flying into the underbrush. My leg \\nslows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not as \\nspeedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their \\ncoughs, their raspy voices calling to one another. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nStill, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, \\nand so I do what I have done my whole life in such \\ncircumstances. I pick a high tree and begin to climb. \\nIf running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it \\nrequires not only exertion but direct contact of my \\nhands on the tree bark. I\\'m fast, though, and by the \\ntime they\\'ve reached the base of my trunk, I\\'m twenty \\nfeet up. For a moment, we stop and survey one \\nanother. I hope they can\\'t hear the pounding of my \\nheart. \\n\\nThis could be it, I think. What chance do I have \\nagainst them? All six are there, the five Careers and \\nPeeta, and my only consolation is they\\'re pretty beat- \\nup, too. Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their \\nfaces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above \\nthem. It seems pretty hopeless. But then something \\nelse registers. They\\'re bigger and stronger than I am, \\nno doubt, but they\\'re also heavier. There\\'s a reason \\nit\\'s me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the \\nhighest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests. I \\nmust weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the \\nsmallest Career. \\n\\nNow I smile. \"How\\'s everything with you?\" I call down \\ncheerfully. \\n\\nThis takes them aback, but I know the crowd will love \\nit. \\n\\n\"Well enough,\" says the boy from District \\n2. \"Yourself?\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s been a bit warm for my taste,\" I say. I can almost \\nhear the laughter from the Capitol. \"The air\\'s better \\nup here. Why don\\'t you come on up?\" \\n\\n\"Think I will,\" says the same boy. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here, take this, Cato,\" says the girl from District 1, \\nand she offers him the silver bow and sheath of \\narrows. My bow! My arrows! Just the sight of them \\nmakes me so angry I want to scream, at myself, at \\nthat traitor Peeta for distracting me from having \\nthem. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he \\nseems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he \\npolishes his knife with the edge of his shirt. \\n\\n\"No,\" says Cato, pushing away the bow. \"Ill do better \\nwith my sword.\" I can see the weapon, a short, heavy \\nblade at his belt. \\n\\nI give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I \\nbegin to climb again. Gale always says I remind him \\nof a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the \\nslenderest limb. Part of it\\'s my weight, but part of it\\'s \\npractice. You have to know where to place your hands \\nand feet. I\\'m another thirty feet in the air when I hear \\nthe crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and \\na branch go down. He hits the ground hard and I\\'m \\nhoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back \\nto his feet, swearing like a fiend. \\n\\nThe girl with the arrows, Glimmer I hear someone call \\nher \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ugh, the names the people in District 1 give \\ntheir children are so ridiculous \\xe2\\x80\\x94 anyway Glimmer \\nscales the tree until the branches begin to crack \\nunder her feet and then has the good sense to stop. \\nI\\'m at least eighty feet high now. She tries to shoot me \\nand it\\'s immediately evident that she\\'s incompetent \\nwith a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree \\nnear me though and I\\'m able to seize it. I wave it \\nteasingly above her head, as if this was the sole \\npurpose of retrieving it, when actually I mean to use it \\nif I ever get the chance. I could kill them, everyone of \\nthem, if those silver weapons were in my hands. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear \\nthem growling conspiratorially among themselves, \\nfurious I have made them look foolish. But twilight \\nhas arrived and their window of attack on me is \\nclosing. Finally, I hear Peeta say harshly, \"Oh, let her \\nstay up there. It\\'s not like she\\'s going anywhere. We\\'ll \\ndeal with her in the morning.\" \\n\\nWell, he\\'s right about one thing. I\\'m going nowhere. \\nAll the relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me \\nto feel the full potency of my burns. I scoot down to a \\nfork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed. Put on \\nmy jacket. Lay out my sleeping bed. Belt myself in \\nand try to keep from moaning. The heat of the bag\\'s \\ntoo much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and \\nhang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on \\nthe wound, my hands. \\n\\nAll my bravado is gone. I\\'m weak from pain and \\nhunger but can\\'t bring myself to eat. Even if I can last \\nthe night, what will the morning bring? I stare into \\nthe foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns \\nforbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing \\nlullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An \\nowl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through \\nthe smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from \\nthe neighboring tree \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a possum maybe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 catching \\nthe firelight from the Careers \\'torches. Suddenly, I\\'m \\nup on one elbow. Those are no possum\\'s eyes, I know \\ntheir glassy reflection too well. In fact, those are not \\nanimal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of light, I make \\nher out, watching me silently from between the \\nbranches. Rue. \\n\\nHow long has she been here? The whole time \\nprobably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded \\nbeneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree shortly \\nbefore I did, hearing the pack was so close. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nFor a while we hold each other\\'s gaze. Then, without \\neven rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the \\nopen and points to something above my head. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMy eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage \\nabove me. At first, I have no idea what she\\'s pointing \\nto, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the \\nvague shape in the dimming light. But of ... of what? \\nSome sort of animal? It looks about the size of a \\nraccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, \\nswaying ever so slightly. There\\'s something else. \\nAmong the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my \\nears register a low hum. Then I know. It\\'s a wasp \\nnest. \\n\\nFear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to \\nkeep still. After all, I don\\'t know what kind of wasp \\nlives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone- \\nand-well-leave-you-alone type. But these are the \\nHunger Games, and ordinary isn\\'t the norm. More \\nlikely they will be one of the Capitol\\'s muttations, \\ntracker j ackers. Like the jabberjays, thesekiller wasps \\nwere spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like \\nland mines, around the districts during the war. \\nLarger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive \\nsolid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the size \\nof a plum on contact. Most people can\\'t tolerate more \\nthan a few stings. Some die at once. If you live, the \\nhallucinations brought on by the venom have actually \\ndriven people to madness. And there\\'s another thing, \\nthese wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs \\ntheir nest and attempt to kill them. That\\'s where the \\ntracker part of the name comes from. \\n\\nAfter the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests \\nsurrounding their city, but the ones near the districts \\nwere left untouched. Another reminder of our \\nweakness, I suppose, just like the Hunger Games. \\nAnother reason to keep inside the fence of District 12. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest, \\nwe immediately head in the opposite direction. \\n\\nSo is that what hangs above me? I look back to Rue \\nfor help, but she\\'s melted into her tree. \\n\\nGiven my circumstances, I guess it doesn\\'t matter \\nwhat type of wasp nest it is. I\\'m wounded and \\ntrapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but \\nby the time the sun rises, the Careers will have \\nformulated a plan to kill me. There\\'s no way they \\ncould do otherwise after I\\'ve made them look so \\nstupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If \\nI can drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. \\nBut I\\'ll risk my life in the process. \\n\\nOf course, I\\'ll never be able to get in close enough to \\nthe actual nest to cut it free. I\\'ll have to saw off the \\nbranch at the trunk and send the whole thing down. \\nThe serrated portion of my knife should be able to \\nmanage that. But can my hands? And will the \\nvibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And what \\nif the Careers figure out what I\\'m doing and move \\ntheir camp? That would defeat the whole purpose. \\n\\nI realize that the best chance I\\'ll have to do the sawing \\nwithout drawing notice will be during the anthem. \\nThat could begin any time. I drag myself out of my \\nbag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and \\nbegin to make my way up the tree. This in itself is \\ndangerous since the branches are becoming \\nprecariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I \\nreach the limb that supports the nest, the humming \\nbecomes more distinctive. But it\\'s still oddly subdued \\nif these are tracker jackers. It\\'s the smoke, I think. It\\'s \\nsedated them. This was the one defense the rebels \\nfound to battle the wasps. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe seal of the Capitol shines above me and the \\nanthem blares out. It\\'s now or never, I think, and \\nbegin to saw. Blisters burst on my right hand as I \\nawkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once I\\'ve \\ngot a groove, the work requires less effort but is \\nalmost more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and \\nsaw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register \\nthat there were no deaths today. That\\'s all right. The \\naudience will be sated seeing me injured and treed \\nand the pack below me. But the anthem\\'s running \\nout and I\\'m only three quarters of the way through \\nthe wood when the music ends, the sky goes dark, \\nand I\\'m forced to stop. \\n\\nNow what? I could probably finish off the job by sense \\nof feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the \\nwasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way \\ndown, if I try to escape, this could all be a deadly \\nwaste of time. Better, I think, to sneak up here at \\ndawn and send the nest into my enemies. \\n\\nIn the faint light of the Careers\\' torches, I inch back \\ndown to my fork to find the best surprise I\\'ve ever \\nhad. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot \\nattached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a \\nsponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during \\nthe anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my \\nhand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the \\nlid and I know by the scent that it\\'s medicine. \\nCautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The \\nthrobbing in my fingertip vanishes. \\n\\n\"Oh, Haymitch,\" I whisper. \"Thank you.\" He has not \\nabandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. \\nThe cost of this medicine must be astronomical. \\nProbably not one but many sponsors have \\ncontributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is \\npriceless. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm \\nover my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the \\npain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation \\nbehind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother \\ngrinds up out of woodland plants, it\\'s high-tech \\nmedicine brewed up in the Capitol\\'s labs. When my \\ncalf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After \\nwrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely \\naway in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it\\'s all \\nI can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge \\ninto sleep. \\n\\nA bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that \\na new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I \\nexamine my hands. The medicine has transformed all \\nthe angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg \\nstill feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I \\napply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up \\nmy gear. Whatever happens, I\\'m going to have to \\nmove and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker \\nand a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water. \\n\\nAlmost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and \\nI\\'m already starting to feel the effects of hunger. \\n\\nBelow me, I can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep \\non the ground. By her position, leaning up against \\nthe trunk of the tree, I\\'d guess Glimmer was \\nsupposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her. \\n\\nMy eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next \\nto me, but I can\\'t make out Rue. Since she tipped me \\noff, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if I\\'m going \\nto die today, it\\'s Rue I want to win. Even if it means a \\nlittle extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being \\ncrowned victor is unbearable. \\n\\nI call Rue\\'s name in a hushed whisper and the eyes \\nappear, wide and alert, at once. She points up to the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nnest again. I hold up my knife and make a sawing \\nmotion. She nods and disappears. There\\'s a rustling \\nin a nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit \\nfarther off. I realize she\\'s leaping from tree to tree. It\\'s \\nall I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she \\nshowed the Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around \\nthe training equipment never touching the floor. She \\nshould have gotten at least a ten. \\n\\nRosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I can\\'t \\nafford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of \\nlast night\\'s climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb \\nthat holds the nest, I position the knife in the groove \\nand I\\'m about to draw the teeth across the wood \\nwhen I see something moving. There, on the nest. The \\nbright gold gleam of a tracker j acker lazily making its \\nway across the papery gray surface. No question, it\\'s \\nacting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and \\nmoving and that means the others will be out soon as \\nwell. Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands, \\nbeading up through the ointment, and I do my best to \\npat them dry on my shirt. If I don\\'t get through this \\nbranch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm \\ncould emerge and attack me. \\n\\nThere\\'s no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, \\ngrip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. \\nBack, forth, back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to \\nbuzz and I hear them coming out. Back, forth, back, \\nforth! A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I \\nknow one has found me and the others will be honing \\nin. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife cuts \\nthrough, I shove the end of the branch as far away \\nfrom me as I can. It crashes down through the lower \\nbranches, snagging temporarily on a few but then \\ntwisting free until it smashes with a thud on the \\nground. The nest bursts open like an egg, and a \\nfurious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, \\nand their venom almost immediately makes me \\nwoozy. I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the \\nbarbed stingers out of my flesh. Fortunately, only \\nthese three tracker jackers had identified me before \\nthe nest went down. The rest of the insects have \\ntargeted their enemies on the ground. \\n\\nIt\\'s mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale \\ntracker jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the \\nsense to drop everything and bolt. I can hear cries of \\n\"To the lake! To the lake!\" and know they hope to \\nevade the wasps by taking to the water. It must be \\nclose if they think they can outdistance the furious \\ninsects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from \\nDistrict 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple \\nstings before they\\'re even out of my view. Glimmer \\nappears to go completely mad, shrieking and trying to \\nbat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless. \\nShe calls to the others for help but, of course, no one \\nreturns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight, \\nalthough I wouldn\\'t bet on her making it to the lake. I \\nwatch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the \\nground for a few minutes, and then go still. \\n\\nThe nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps \\nhave vanished in pursuit of the others. I don\\'t think \\nthey\\'ll return, but I don\\'t want to risk it. I scamper \\ndown the tree and hit the ground running in the \\nopposite direction of the lake. The poison from the \\nstingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way back to \\nmy own little pool and submerge myself in the water, \\njust in case any wasps are still on my trail. After \\nabout five minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. \\nPeople have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker \\njacker stings. Actually, the one on my knee is closer \\nto an orange than a plum in size. A foul- smelling \\ngreen liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out \\nthe stingers. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer \\ntwitching to death on the ground. It\\'s a lot to handle \\nbefore the sun has even cleared the horizon. I don\\'t \\nwant to think about what Glimmer must look like \\nnow. Her body disfigured. Her swollen fingers \\nstiffening around the bow . . . \\n\\nThe bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one \\nthought connects to another and I\\'m on my feet, \\nteetering through the trees back to Glimmer. The \\nbow. The arrows. I must get them. I haven\\'t heard the \\ncannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort \\nof coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp \\nvenom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her \\ndeath, a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, \\ntaking the only bow and sheath of arrows I\\'ve seen \\nout of the Games for good. And I refuse to let them \\nslip through my fingers again! \\n\\nI reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker \\njackers have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly \\nbeautiful in her golden dress the night of the \\ninterviews, is unrecognizable. Her features eradicated, \\nher limbs three times their normal size. The stinger \\nlumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green \\nliquid around her. I have to break several of what \\nused to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. \\nThe sheath of arrows is pinned under her back. I try \\nto roll over her body by pulling on one arm, but the \\nflesh disintegrates in my hands and I fall back on the \\nground. \\n\\nIs this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I \\nsqueeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my \\nmouth, ordering myself not to become sick. Breakfast \\nmust stay down, it might be days before I can hunt \\nagain. A second cannon fires and I\\'m guessing the girl \\nfrom District 4 has just died. I hear the birds fall \\nsilent and then one give the warning call, which \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nmeans a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I \\nthink it\\'s for Glimmer, although this doesn\\'t quite \\nmake sense because I\\'m still in the picture, still \\nfighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto my knees \\nand the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In \\nthe middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw \\nmyself over Glimmer\\'s body as if to protect it but then \\nI see the girl from District 4 being lifted into the air \\nand vanishing. \\n\\n\"Do this!\" I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig \\nmy hands under Glimmer\\'s body, get a hold on what \\nmust be her rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. \\nI can\\'t help it, I\\'m hyperventilating now, the whole \\nthing is so nightmarish and I\\'m losing my grasp on \\nwhat\\'s real. I tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but \\nit\\'s caught on something, her shoulder blade, \\nsomething, and finally yank it free. I\\'ve just encircled \\nthe sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, \\nseveral pairs, coming through the underbrush, and I \\nrealize the Careers have come back. They\\'ve come \\nback to kill me or get their weapons or both. \\n\\nBut it\\'s too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the \\nsheath and try to position it on the bowstring but \\ninstead of one string I see three and the stench from \\nthe stings is so repulsive I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t do it. I \\ncan\\'t do it. \\n\\nI\\'m helpless as the first hunter crashes through the \\ntrees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on \\nPeeta\\'s face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow. \\nInstead his arm drops to his side. \\n\\n\"What are you still doing here?\" he hisses at me. I \\nstare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips \\noff a sting under his ear. His whole body starts \\nsparkling as if he\\'s been dipped in dew. \"Are you \\nmad?\" He\\'s prodding me with the shaft of the spear \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nnow. \"Get up! Get up!\" I rise, but he\\'s still pushing at \\nme. What? What is going on? He shoves me away \\nfrom him hard. \"RunF\\'he screams. \"Run!\" \\n\\nBehind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. \\nHe\\'s sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one \\neye. I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do \\nas Peeta says. Holding tightly to my bow and arrows, \\nbanging into trees that appear out of nowhere, \\ntripping and falling as I try to keep my balance. Back \\npast my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world \\nbegins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons \\nto the size of a house then shatters into a million \\nstars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over \\nmy boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on \\nmy hands and I can\\'t shake them free. They\\'re \\nclimbing up my arms, my neck. Someone\\'s \\nscreaming, a long high pitched scream that never \\nbreaks for breath. I have a vague idea it might be me. \\nI trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange \\nbubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest. \\nTucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for death. \\n\\nSick and disoriented, I\\'m able to form only one \\nthought: Peeta Mellark just saved my life. \\n\\nThen the ants bore into my eyes and I black out. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only \\nto find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I \\ndread most, all the things I dread for others manifest \\nin such vivid detail I can\\'t help but believe they\\'re \\nreal. Each time I wake, I think, At last, this is over, \\nbut it isn\\'t. It\\'s only the beginning of a new chapter of \\ntorture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive \\nmy father\\'s last moments? Feel my own body ripped \\napart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, \\nso carefully created to target the place where fear lives \\nin your brain. \\n\\nWhen I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting \\nfor the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I \\naccept that the poison must have finally worked its \\nway out of my system, leaving my body wracked and \\nfeeble. I\\'m still lying on my side, locked in the fetal \\nposition. I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound, \\nuntouched by ants that never existed. Simply \\nstretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. \\nSo many parts of me hurt, it doesn\\'t seem worthwhile \\ntaking inventory of them. Very, very slowly I manage \\nto sit up. I\\'m in a shallow hole, not filled with the \\nhumming orange bubbles of my hallucination but \\nwith old, dead leaves. My clothing\\'s damp, but I don\\'t \\nknow whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the \\ncause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips \\nfrom my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of \\na honeysuckle bush. \\n\\nHow long have I been out? It was morning when I lost \\nreason. Now it\\'s afternoon. But the stiffness in my \\njoints suggests more than a day has passed, even two \\npossibly. If so, 111 have no way of knowing which \\ntributes survived that tracker jacker attack. Not \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nGlimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was the \\nboy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and \\nPeeta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they \\nlived, their last days must have been as horrid as my \\nown. And what about Rue? She\\'s so small, it wouldn\\'t \\ntake much venom to do her in. But then again ... the \\ntracker j ackers would\\'ve had to catch her, and she \\nhad a good head start. \\n\\nA foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water \\nhas little effect on it. I drag myself over to the \\nhoneysuckle bush and pluck a flower. I gently pull \\nthe stamen through the blossom and set the drop of \\nnectar on my tongue. The sweetness spreads through \\nmy mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with \\nmemories of summer, and my home woods and Gale\\'s \\npresence beside me. For some reason, our discussion \\nfrom that last morning comes back to me. \\n\\n\"We could do it, you know.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" \\n\\n\"Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You \\nand I, we could make it.\" \\n\\nAnd suddenly, I\\'m not thinking of Gale but of Peeta \\nand ... Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by \\nthe time we met up, I couldn\\'t tell what was real and \\nwhat the tracker j acker venom had caused me to \\nimagine. But if he did, and my instincts tell me he \\ndid, what for? Is he simply working the Lover Boy \\nangle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually \\ntrying to protect me? And if he was, what was he \\ndoing with those Careers in the first place? None of it \\nmakes sense. \\n\\nI wonder what Gale made of the incident for a \\nmoment and then I push the whole thing out of my \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nmind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not \\ncoexist well together in my thoughts. \\n\\nSo I focus on the one really good thing that\\'s \\nhappened since I landed in the arena. I have a bow \\nand arrows! A full dozen arrows if you count the one I \\nretrieved in the tree. They bear no trace of the \\nnoxious green slime that came from Glimmer\\'s body \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which leads me to believe that might not have been \\nwholly real \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but they have a fair amount of dried \\nblood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a \\nminute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are \\nmore like the weapons in the Training Center than my \\nones at home, but who cares? That I can work with. \\n\\nThe weapons give me an entirely new perspective on \\nthe Games. I know I have tough opponents left to \\nface. But I am no longer merely prey that runs and \\nhides or takes desperate measures. If Cato broke \\nthrough the trees right now, I wouldn\\'t flee, I\\'d shoot. \\nI find I\\'m actually anticipating the moment with \\npleasure. \\n\\nBut first, I have to get some strength back in my \\nbody. I\\'m very dehydrated again and my water supply \\nis dangerously low. The little padding I was able to \\nput on by gorging myself during prep time in the \\nCapitol is gone, plus several more pounds as well. My \\nhip bones and ribs are more prominent than I \\nremember them being since those awful months after \\nmy father\\'s death. And then there are my wounds to \\ncontend with \\xe2\\x80\\x94 burns, cuts, and bruises from \\nsmashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker \\nstings, which are as sore and swollen as ever. I treat \\nmy burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on \\nmy stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My \\nmother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf \\nthat could draw out the poison, but she seldom had \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ncause to use it, and I don\\'t even remember its name \\nlet alone its appearance. \\n\\nWater first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. \\nIt\\'s easy to see the direction I came from by the path \\nof destruction my crazed body made through the \\nfoliage. So I walk off in the other direction, hoping my \\nenemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker \\nj acker venom. \\n\\nI can\\'t move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt \\nmotions. But I establish the slow hunter\\'s tread I use \\nwhen tracking game. Within a few minutes, I spot a \\nrabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. \\nIt\\'s not my usual clean shot through the eye, but 111 \\ntake it. After about an hour, I find a stream, shallow \\nbut wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The \\nsun\\'s hot and severe, so while I wait for my water to \\npurify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into \\nthe mild current. I\\'m filthy from head to toe, I try \\nsplashing myself but eventually just lay down in the \\nwater for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot \\nand blood and skin that has started to peel off my \\nburns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them \\non bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a \\nbit, untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite \\nreturns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a \\nhandful of moss, I polish the blood from my silver \\nweapons. \\n\\nRefreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my \\nhair, and dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun \\nwill dry them soon enough. Following the stream \\nagainst its current seems the smartest course of \\naction. I\\'m traveling uphill now, which I prefer, with a \\nsource of fresh water not only for myself but possible \\ngame. I easily take out a strange bird that must be \\nsome form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty \\nedible to me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nsmall fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help \\nconceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by \\nnightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care with the \\nbird, but there\\'s nothing alarming about it. Once the \\nfeathers are plucked, it\\'s no bigger than a chicken, \\nbut it\\'s plump and firm. I\\'ve just placed the first lot \\nover the coals when I hear the twig snap. \\n\\nIn one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow \\nand arrow to my shoulder. There\\'s no one there. No \\none I can see anyway. Then I spot the tip of a child\\'s \\nboot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. \\nMy shoulders relax and I grin. She can move through \\nthe woods like a shadow, you have to give her that. \\nHow else could she have followed me? The words \\ncome out of my mouth before I can stop them. \\n\\n\"You know, they\\'re not the only ones who can form \\nalliances,\" I say. \\n\\nFor a moment, no response. Then one of Rue\\'s eyes \\nedges around the trunk. \"You want me for an ally?\" \\n\\n\"Why not? You saved me with those tracker j ackers. \\nYou\\'re smart enough to still be alive. And I can\\'t seem \\nto shake you anyway,\" I say. She blinks at me, trying \\nto decide. \"You hungry?\" I can see her swallow hard, \\nher eye flickering to the meat. \"Come on then, I\\'ve had \\ntwo kills today.\" \\n\\nRue tentatively steps out into the open. \"I can fix your \\nstings.\" \\n\\n\"Can you?\" I ask. \"How?\" \\n\\nShe digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a \\nhandful of leaves. I\\'m almost certain they\\'re the ones \\nmy mother uses. \"Where \\'d you find those?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Just around. We all carry them when we work in the \\norchards. They left a lot of nests there,\" says Rue. \\n\"There are a lot here, too.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s right. You\\'re District Eleven. Agriculture,\" I \\nsay. \"Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly \\naround the trees like you\\'ve got wings.\" Rue smiles. \\nI\\'ve landed on one of the few things shell admit pride \\nin. \"Well, come on, then. Fix me up.\" \\n\\nI plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to \\nreveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue \\nplaces the handful of leaves into her mouth and \\nbegins to chew them. My mother would use other \\nmethods, but it\\'s not like we have a lot of options. \\nAfter a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad \\nof chewed leaves and spit on my knee. \\n\\n\"Ohhh.\" The sound comes out of my mouth before I \\ncan stop it. It\\'s as if the leaves are actually leaching \\nthe pain right out of the sting. \\n\\nRue gives a giggle. \"Lucky you had the sense to pull \\nthe stingers out or you\\'d be a lot worse.\" \\n\\n\"Do my neck! Do my cheek!\" I almost beg. \\n\\nRue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, \\nand soon I\\'m laughing because the relief is so sweet. I \\nnotice a long burn on Rue\\'s forearm. \"I\\'ve got \\nsomething for that.\" I set aside my weapons and \\nanoint her arm with the burn medicine. \\n\\n\"You have good sponsors,\" she says longingly. \\n\\n\"Have you gotten anything yet?\" I ask. She shakes her \\nhead. \"You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to \\nthe end, the more people will realize how clever you \\nare.\" I turn the meat over. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You weren\\'t joking, about wanting me for an ally?\" \\nshe asks. \\n\\n\"No, I meant it,\" I say. I can almost hear Haymitch \\ngroaning as I team up with this wispy child. But I \\nwant her. Because she\\'s a survivor, and I trust her, \\nand why not admit it? She reminds me of Prim. \\n\\n\"Okay,\" she says, and holds out her hand. We \\nshake.\"It\\'s a deal.\" \\n\\nOf course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, \\nbut neither of us mentions that. \\n\\nRue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy \\nroot to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the \\nsharp sweet taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the \\nbird, too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her \\ndistrict. She says sometimes a flock will wander into \\nthe orchard and they get a decent lunch that day. For \\na while, all conversation stops as we fill our \\nstomachs. The groosling has delicious meal that\\'s so \\nfatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite \\ninto it. \\n\\n\"Oh,\" says Rue with a sigh. \"I\\'ve never had a whole leg \\nto myself before.\" \\n\\nI\\'ll bet she hasn\\'t. Ill bet meat hardly ever comes her \\nway. \"Take the other,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Really?\" she asks. \\n\\n\"Take whatever you want. Now that I\\'ve got a bow and \\narrows, I can get more. Plus I\\'ve got snares. I can \\nshow you how to set them,\" I say. Rue still looks \\nuncertainly at the leg. \"Oh, take it,\" I say, putting the \\ndrumstick in her hands. \"It will only keep a few days \\nanyway, and we\\'ve got the whole bird plus the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nrabbit. \"Once she\\'s got hold of it, her appetite wins out \\nand she takes a huge mouthful. \\n\\n\"I\\'d have thought, in District Eleven, you\\'d have a bit \\nmore to eat than us. You know, since you grow the \\nfood,\" I say. \\n\\nRue\\'s eyes widen. \"Oh, no, we\\'re not allowed to eat \\nthe crops.\" \\n\\n\"They arrest you or something?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"They whip you and make everyone else watch,\" says \\nRue. \"The mayor\\'s very strict about it.\" \\n\\nI can tell by her expression that it\\'s not that \\nuncommon an occurrence. A public whipping\\'s a rare \\nthing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. \\nTechnically, Gale and I could be whipped on a daily \\nbasis for poaching in the woods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well, technically, \\nwe could get a whole lot worse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 except all the \\nofficials buy our meat. Besides, our mayor, Madge\\'s \\nfather, doesn\\'t seem to have much taste for such \\nevents. Maybe being the least prestigious, poorest, \\nmost ridiculed district in the country has its \\nadvantages. Such as, being largely ignored by the \\nCapitol as long as we produce our coal quotas. \\n\\n\"Do you get all the coal you want?\" Rue asks. \\n\\n\"No,\" I answer. \"Just what we buy and whatever we \\ntrack in on our boots.\" \\n\\n\"They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that \\npeople can keep going longer,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t you have to be in school?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not during harvest. Everyone works then,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting, hearing about her life. We have so \\nlittle communication with anyone outside our district. \\nIn fact, I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out \\nour conversation, because even though the \\ninformation seems harmless, they don\\'t want people \\nin different districts to know about one another. \\n\\nAt Rue\\'s suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan \\nahead. She\\'s seen most of mine, but I add the last \\ncouple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. She\\'s \\ngathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and \\neven some berries. \\n\\nI roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. \"You sure this \\nis safe?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, yes, we have them back home. I\\'ve been eating \\nthem for days,\" she says, popping a handful in her \\nmouth. I tentatively bite into one, and it\\'s as good as \\nour blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally seems a \\nbetter choice all the time. We divide up our food \\nsupplies, so in case we\\'re separated, well both be set \\nfor a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small \\nwater skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair \\nof socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses \\nas a knife. \"I know it\\'s not much, \"she says as if \\nembarrassed, \"but I had to get away from the \\nCornucopia fast.\" \\n\\n\"You did just right,\" I say. When I spread out my gear, \\nshe gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses. \\n\\n\"How did you get those?\" she asks. \\n\\n\"In my pack. They\\'ve been useless so far. They don\\'t \\nblock the sun and they make it harder to see,\" I say \\nwith a shrug. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"These aren\\'t for sun, they\\'re for darkness,\" exclaims \\nRue. \"Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, \\nthey\\'ll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in \\nthe trees. Where the torchlight doesn\\'t reach. One \\ntime, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it \\nin his pants. They killed him on the spot.\" \\n\\n\"They killed a boy for taking these?\" I say. \\n\\n\"Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin \\nwasn\\'t right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a \\nthree-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play \\nwith,\" says Rue. \\n\\nHearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some \\nsort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from \\nstarvation all the time, but I can\\'t imagine the \\nPeacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. \\nThere\\'s a little girl, one of Greasy Sae\\'s grandkids, \\nwho wanders around the Hob. She\\'s not quite right, \\nbut she\\'s treated as a sort of pet. People toss her \\nscraps and things. \\n\\n\"So what do these do?\" I ask Rue, taking the glasses. \\n\\n\"They let you see in complete darkness,\" says Rue. \\n\"Try them tonight when the sun goes down.\" \\n\\nI give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have \\nplenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We \\nextinguish our fire and head upstream until it\\'s \\nalmost nightfall. \\n\\n\"Where do you sleep?\" I ask her. \"In the trees?\" She \\nnods. \"In just your jacket?\" \\n\\nRue holds up her extra pair of socks. \"I have these for \\nmy hands.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI think of how cold the nights have been. \"You can \\nshare my sleeping bag if you want. Well both easily \\nfit.\" Her face lights up. I can tell this is more than she \\ndared hope for. \\n\\nWe pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the \\nnight just as the anthem begins to play. There were \\nno deaths today. \\n\\n\"Rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I \\nmiss?\"The anthem should block out our words, but \\nstill I whisper. I even take the precaution of covering \\nmy lips with my hand. I don\\'t want the audience to \\nknow what I\\'m planning to tell her about Peeta. \\nTaking a cue from me, she does the same. \\n\\n\"Two,\" she says. \"The girls from Districts One and \\nFour are dead. There\\'s ten of us left.\" \\n\\n\"Something strange happened. At least, I think it did. \\nIt might have been the tracker j acker venom making \\nme imagine things,\" I say. \"You know the boy from my \\ndistrict? Peeta? I think he saved my life. But he was \\nwith the Careers.\" \\n\\n\"He\\'s not with them now,\" she says. \"I\\'ve spied on \\ntheir base camp by the lake. They made it back before \\nthey collapsed from the stingers. But he\\'s not there. \\nMaybe he did save you and had to run.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I\\'m in his \\ndebt again. And this can\\'t be paid back. \"If he did, it \\nwas all probably just part of his act. You know, to \\nmake people think he\\'s in love with me.\" \\n\\n\"Oh,\" says Rue thoughtfully. \"I didn\\'t think that was \\nan act.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Course it is,\" I say. \"He worked it out with our \\nmentor.\" The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. \\n\"Let\\'s try out these glasses.\" I pull out the glasses and \\nslip them on. Rue wasn\\'t kidding. I can see everything \\nfrom the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling \\nthrough the bushes a good fifty feet away. I could kill \\nit from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone. \\n\\n\"I wonder who else got a pair of these,\" I say. \\n\\n\"The Careers have two pairs. But they\\'ve got \\neverything down by the lake,\" Rue says. \"And they\\'re \\nso strong.\" \\n\\n\"We\\'re strong, too,\" I say. \"Just in a different way.\" \\n\\n\"You are. You can shoot,\" she says. \"What can I do?\" \\n\\n\"You can feed yourself. Can they?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"They don\\'t need to. They have all those supplies,\" \\nRue says. \\n\\n\"Say they didn\\'t. Say the supplies were gone. How \\nlong would they last?\" I say. \"I mean, it\\'s the Hunger \\nGames, right?\" \\n\\n\"But, Katniss, they\\'re not hungry,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\"No, they\\'re not. That\\'s the problem,\" I agree. And for \\nthe first time, I have a plan. A plan that isn\\'t \\nmotivated by the need for flight and evasion. An \\noffensive plan. \"I think we\\'re going to have to fix that, \\nRue.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nRue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know \\nthis because as soon as the anthem finishes she \\nsnuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I \\nhave any misgivings about her, as I take no particular \\nprecautions. If she\\'d wanted me dead, all she would \\nhave had to do was disappear from that tree without \\npointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling me, at \\nthe very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us \\ncan\\'t win these Games. But since the odds are still \\nagainst either of us surviving, I manage to ignore the \\nthought. \\n\\nBesides, I\\'m distracted by my latest idea about the \\nCareers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must \\nfind a way to destroy their food. I\\'m pretty sure \\nfeeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. \\nTraditionally, the Career tributes\\' strategy is to get \\nhold of all the food early on and work from there. The \\nyears when they have not protected it well \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one year \\na pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a \\nGamemakers\\' flood washed it away \\xe2\\x80\\x94 those are \\nusually the years that tributes from other districts \\nhave won. That the Careers have been better red \\ngrowing up is actually to their disadvantage, because \\nthey don\\'t know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue \\nand I do. \\n\\nBut I\\'m too exhausted to begin any detailed plan \\ntonight. My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit \\nfoggy from the venom, and the warmth of Rue at my \\nside, her head cradled on my shoulder, have given me \\na sense of security. I realize, for the first time, how \\nvery lonely I\\'ve been in the arena. How comforting the \\npresence of another human being can be. I give in to \\nmy drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nwill turn. Tomorrow, it\\'s the Careers who will have to \\nwatch their backs. \\n\\nThe boom of the cannon jolts me awake. The sky\\'s \\nstreaked with light, the birds already chattering. Rue \\nperches in a branch across from me, her hands \\ncupping something. We wait, listening for more shots, \\nbut there aren\\'t any. \\n\\n\"Who do you think that was?\" I can\\'t help thinking of \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. It could have been any of the \\nothers, \"says Rue. \"I guess well know tonight.\" \\n\\n\"Who\\'s left again?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"The boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. \\nThe boy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and \\nPeeta,\" says Rue. \"That\\'s eight. Wait, and the boy from \\nTen, the one with the bad leg. He makes nine.\" \\n\\nThere\\'s someone else, but neither of us can remember \\nwho it is. \\n\\n\"I wonder how that last one died,\" says Rue. \\n\\n\"No telling. But it\\'s good for us. A death should hold \\nthe crowd for a bit. Maybe well have time to do \\nsomething before the Gamemakers decide things have \\nbeen moving too slowly,\" I say. \"What\\'s in your \\nhands?\" \\n\\n\"Breakfast,\" says Rue. She holds them out revealing \\ntwo big eggs. \\n\\n\"What kind are those?\" I ask. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not sure. There\\'s a marshy area over that way. Some \\nkind of waterbird,\" she says. \\n\\nIt\\'d be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to \\nrisk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was \\na victim of the Careers, which means they\\'ve \\nrecovered enough to be back in the Games. We each \\nsuck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and \\nsome berries. It\\'s a good breakfast anywhere. \\n\\n\"Ready to do it?\" I say, pulling on my pack. \\n\\n\"Do what?\" says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, \\nyou can tell she\\'s up for whatever I propose. \\n\\n\"Today we take out the Careers\\' food,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Really? How?\" You can see the glint of excitement in \\nher eyes. In this way, she\\'s exactly the opposite of \\nPrim for whom adventures are an ordeal. \\n\\n\"No idea. Come on, well figure out a plan while we \\nhunt,\" I say. \\n\\nWe don\\'t get much hunting done though because I\\'m \\ntoo busy getting every scrap of information I can out \\nof Rue about the Careers\\' base. She\\'s only been in to \\nspy on them briefly, but she\\'s observant. They have \\nset up their camp beside the lake. Their supply stash \\nis about thirty yards away. During the day, they\\'ve \\nbeen leaving another tribute, the boy from District 3, \\nto watch over the supplies. \\n\\n\"The boy from District Three?\" I ask. \"He\\'s working \\nwith them?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, \\ntoo, when they drew the tracker j ackers in by the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nlake,\" says Rue. \"I guess they agreed to let him live if \\nhe acted as their guard. But he\\'s not very big.\" \\n\\n\"What weapons does he have?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not much that I could see. A spear. He might be able \\nto hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill \\nhim easily,\"says Rue. \\n\\n\"And the food\\'s just out in the open?\" I say. She \\nnods. \"Something\\'s not quite right about that whole \\nsetup.\" \\n\\n\"I know. But I couldn\\'t tell what exactly,\" says \\nRue.\"Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how \\nwould you get rid of it?\" \\n\\n\"Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel.\" I poke \\nRue in the belly, just like I would Prim. \"Eat it!\" She \\ngiggles. \"Don\\'t worry, 111 think of something. \\nDestroying things is much easier than making them.\" \\n\\nFor a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and \\ngreens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I \\ncome to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely \\nprotective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the \\nyounger ones, who forages in the meadows in a \\ndistrict where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging \\nthan ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves \\nmost in the world, replies, of all things, \"Music.\" \\n\\n\"Music?\" I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere \\nbetween hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of \\nusefulness. At least a rainbow gives you a tip about \\nthe weather. \"You have a lot of time for that?\" \\n\\n\"We sing at home. At work, too. That\\'s why I love your \\npin,\" she says, pointing to the mockingjay that I\\'ve \\nagain forgotten about. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have mocking]\\' ays?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Oh, yes. I have a few that are my special friends. We \\ncan sing back and forth for hours. They carry \\nmessages for me,\" she says. \\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" I say. \\n\\n\"I\\'m usually up highest, so I\\'m the first to see the flag \\nthat signals quitting time. There\\'s a special little song \\nI do,\" says Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a \\nlittle four-note run in a sweet, clear voice. \"And the \\nmockingj ays spread it around the orchard. That\\'s how \\neveryone knows to knock off,\" she continues. \"They \\ncan be dangerous though, if you get too near their \\nnests. But you can\\'t blame them for that.\" \\n\\nI unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. \"Here, you \\ntake it. It has more meaning for you than me.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, no,\" says Rue, closing my fingers back over the \\npin. \"I like to see it on you. That\\'s how I decided I \\ncould trust you. Besides, I have this.\" She pulls a \\nnecklace woven out of some kind of grass from her \\nshirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved wooden star. Or \\nmaybe it\\'s a flower. \"It\\'s a good luck charm.\" \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s worked so far,\" I say, pinning the \\nmockingjay back on my shirt. \"Maybe you should just \\nstick with that.\" \\n\\nBy lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are \\npoised to carry it out. I help Rue collect and place the \\nwood for the first two campfires, the third shell have \\ntime for on her own. We decide to meet afterward at \\nthe site where we ate our first meal together. The \\nstream should help guide me back to it. Before I \\nleave, I make sure Rue\\'s well stocked with food and \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nmatches. I even insist she take my sleeping bag, in \\ncase it\\'s not possible to rendezvous by nightfall. \\n\\n\"What about you? Won\\'t you be cold?\" she asks. \\n\\n\"Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake,\" I \\nsay. \"You know, stealing isn\\'t illegal here,\" I say with a \\ngrin. \\n\\nAt the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her \\nmockingj ay signal, the one she gives to indicate the \\nday\\'s work is done. \"It might not work. But if you hear \\nthe mockingjays singing it, youll know I\\'m okay, only \\nI can\\'t get back right away.\" \\n\\n\"Are there many mockingjays here?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Haven\\'t you seen them? They\\'ve got nests \\neverywhere, \"she says. I have to admit I haven\\'t \\nnoticed. \\n\\n\"Okay, then. If all goes according to plan, 111 see you \\nfor dinner,\" I say. \\n\\nUnexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. I only \\nhesitate a moment before I hug her back. \\n\\n\"You be careful,\" she says to me. \\n\\n\"You, too,\" I say. I turn and head back to the stream, \\nfeeling somehow worried. About Rue being killed, \\nabout Rue not being killed and the two of us being left \\nfor last, about leaving Rue alone, about leaving Prim \\nalone back home. No, Prim has my mother and Gale \\nand a baker who has promised she won\\'t go hungry. \\nRue has only me. \\n\\nOnce I reach the stream, I have only to follow it \\ndownhill to the place I initially picked it up after the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ntracker jacker attack. I have to be cautious as I move \\nalong the water though, because I find my thoughts \\npreoccupied with unanswered questions, most of \\nwhich concern Peeta. The cannon that fired early this \\nmorning, did that signify his death? If so, how did he \\ndie? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge \\nfor letting me live? I struggle again to remember that \\nmoment over Glimmer\\'s body, when he burst through \\nthe trees. But just the fact that he was sparkling \\nleads me to doubt everything that happened. \\n\\nI must have been moving very slowly yesterday \\nbecause I reach the shallow stretch where I took my \\nbath in just a few hours. I stop to replenish my water \\nand add a layer of mud to my backpack. It seems \\nbent on reverting to orange no matter how many \\ntimes I cover it. \\n\\nMy proximity to the Careers\\' camp sharpens my \\nsenses, and the closer I get to them, the more \\nguarded I am, pausing frequently to listen for \\nunnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted into the \\nstring of my bow. I don\\'t see any other tributes, but I \\ndo notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. \\nPatches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves \\nthat healed my stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests \\nin the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in. And here \\nand there, the black-and-white flash of a mockingjay \\nwing in the branches high over my head. \\n\\nWhen I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the \\nfoot, I pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue \\nhas given specific instructions on how to reach the \\nbest spying place near the lake from this point. \\nRemember, I tell myself. You\\'re the hunter now, not \\nthem. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I \\nmake it to the copse Rue has told me about and again \\nhave to admire her cleverness. It\\'s right at the edge of \\nthe wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ncan easily observe the Career camp without being \\nspotted. Between us lies the flat expanse where the \\nGames began. \\n\\nThere are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato \\nand the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen- \\nskinned boy who must be from District 3. He made \\nalmost no impression on me at all during our time in \\nthe Capitol. I can remember almost nothing about \\nhim, not his costume, not his training score, not his \\ninterview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling with \\nsome kind of plastic box, he\\'s easily ignored in the \\npresence of his large and domineering companions. \\nBut he must be of some value or they wouldn\\'t have \\nbothered to let him live. Still, seeing him only adds to \\nmy sense of unease over why the Careers would \\npossibly leave him as a guard, why they have allowed \\nhim to live at all. \\n\\nAll four tributes seem to still be recovering from the \\ntracker jacker attack. Even from here, I can see the \\nlarge swollen lumps on their bodies. They must not \\nhave had the sense to remove the stingers, or if they \\ndid, not known about the leaves that healed them. \\nApparently, whatever medicines they found in the \\nCornucopia have been ineffective. \\n\\nThe Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its \\ninsides have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, \\nheld in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are \\npiled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a \\nquestionable distance from the camp. Others are \\nsprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, \\nalmost mimicking the layout of supplies around the \\nCornucopia at the onset of the Games. A canopy of \\nnetting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to \\nbe useless shelters the pyramid itself. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole setup is completely perplexing. The \\ndistance, the netting, and the presence of the boy \\nfrom District 3. One thing\\'s for sure, destroying those \\nsupplies is not going to be as simple as it looks. Some \\nother factor is at play here, and I\\'d better stay put \\nuntil I figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid \\nis booby-trapped in some manner. I think of \\nconcealed pits, descending nets, a thread that when \\nbroken sends a poisonous dart into your heart. \\nReally, the possibilities are endless. \\n\\nWhile I am mulling over my options, I hear Cato shout \\nout. He\\'s pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, \\nand without turning I know that Rue must have set \\nthe first campfire. We\\'d made sure to gather enough \\ngreen wood to make the smoke noticeable. The \\nCareers begin to arm themselves at once. \\n\\nAn argument breaks out. It\\'s loud enough for me to \\nhear that it concerns whether or not the boy from \\nDistrict 3 should stay or accompany them. \\n\\n\"He\\'s coming. We need him in the woods, and his \\njob\\'s done here anyway. No one can touch those \\nsupplies,\" says Cato. \\n\\n\"What about Lover Boy?\" says the boy from District 1 . \\n\\n\"I keep telling you, forget about him. I know where I \\ncut him. It\\'s a miracle he hasn\\'t bled to death yet. At \\nany rate, he\\'s in no shape to raid us,\" says Cato. \\n\\nSo Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. \\nBut I am still in the dark on what motivated him to \\nbetray the Careers. \\n\\n\"Come on,\" says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the \\nhands of the boy from District 3, and they head off in \\nthe direction of the fire. The last thing I hear as they \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nenter the woods is Cato saying, \"When we find her, I \\nkill her in my own way, and no one interferes.\" \\n\\nSomehow I don\\'t think he\\'s talking about Rue. She \\ndidn\\'t drop a nest of tracker jackers on him. \\n\\nI stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out \\nwhat to do about the supplies. The one advantage I \\nhave with the bow and arrow is distance. I could send \\na flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\'m \\na good enough shot to get it through those openings \\nin the net \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but there\\'s no guarantee it would catch. \\nMore likely it\\'d just burn itself out and then what? I\\'d \\nhave achieved nothing and given them far too much \\ninformation about myself. That I was here, that I have \\nan accomplice, that I can use the bow and arrow with \\naccuracy. \\n\\nThere\\'s no alternative. I\\'m going to have to get in \\ncloser and see if I can\\'t discover what exactly protects \\nthe supplies. In fact, I\\'m just about to reveal myself \\nwhen a movement catches my eye. Several hundred \\nyards to my right, I see someone emerge from the \\nwoods. For a second, I think it\\'s Rue, but then I \\nrecognize Foxface \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she\\'s the one we couldn\\'t \\nremember this morning \\xe2\\x80\\x94 creeping out onto the plain. \\nWhen she decides it\\'s safe, she runs for the pyramid, \\nwith quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the \\ncircle of supplies that have been littered around the \\npyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and \\ncarefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to \\napproach the pyramid with strange little hops, \\nsometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly, \\nsometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she \\nlaunches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands \\npoised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and \\nher momentum throws her forward. I hear her give a \\nsharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but \\nnothing happens. In a moment, she\\'s regained her \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfeet and continues until she has reached the bulk of \\nthe supplies. \\n\\nSo, I\\'m right about the booby trap, but it\\'s clearly \\nmore complex than I had imagined. I was right about \\nthe girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this \\npath into the food and to be able to replicate it so \\nneatly? She fills her pack, taking a few items from a \\nvariety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful \\nof apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended \\nfrom a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful \\nfrom each, not enough to tip off that the food is \\nmissing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then \\nshe\\'s doing her odd little dance back out of the circle \\nand scampering into the woods again, safe and \\nsound. \\n\\nI realize I\\'m grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface \\nhas confirmed what I\\'d already guessed. But what \\nsort of trap have they laid that requires such \\ndexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she \\nsqueal so as her hands made contact with the earth? \\nYou\\'d have thought ... and slowly it begins to dawn on \\nme ... you\\'d have thought the very ground was going \\nto explode. \\n\\n\"It\\'s mined,\" I whisper. That explains everything. The \\nCareers\\' willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface\\'s \\nreaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, \\nwhere they have the factories, where they make \\ntelevisions and automobiles and explosives. But \\nwhere did he get them? In the supplies? That\\'s not \\nthe sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, \\ngiven that they like to see the tributes draw blood \\npersonally. I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of \\nthe round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the \\narena. The ground around it has been dug up and \\npatted back down. The land mines were disabled after \\nthe sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom District 3 must have managed to reactivate \\nthem. I\\'ve never seen anyone in the Games do that. I \\nbet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers. \\n\\nWell, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting \\none over on them, but what am I supposed to do \\nnow? Obviously, I can\\'t go strolling into that mess \\nwithout blowing myself sky-high. As for sending in a \\nburning arrow, that\\'s more laughable than ever. The \\nmines are set off by pressure. It doesn\\'t have to be a \\nlot, either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small \\nwooden ball, while she was at her plate, and they \\nliterally had to scrape bits of her off the ground. \\n\\nMy arm\\'s pretty good, I might be able to chuck some \\nrocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? \\nThat could start a chain reaction. Or could it? Would \\nthe boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such \\na way that a single mine would not disturb the \\nothers? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring \\nthe death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one \\nmine, I\\'d draw the Careers back down on me for sure. \\nAnd anyway, what am I thinking? There\\'s that net, \\nclearly strung to deflect any such attack. Besides, \\nwhat I\\'d really need is to throw about thirty rocks in \\nthere at once, setting off a big chain reaction, \\ndemolishing the whole lot. \\n\\nI glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rue\\'s \\nsecond fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the \\nCareers have probably begun to suspect some sort of \\ntrick. Time is running out. \\n\\nThere is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can \\nonly focus hard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the \\nbins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an \\narrow. Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the \\nburning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could \\nend up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ndirect hit on an oil bin, since I\\'d just be guessing. I\\'m \\ngenuinely thinking of trying to re-create Foxface\\'s trip \\nup to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of \\ndestruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of \\napples. I could sever the rope in one shot, didn\\'t I do \\nas much in the Training Center? It\\'s a big bag, but it \\nstill might only be good for one explosion. If only I \\ncould free the apples themselves ... \\n\\nI know what to do. I move into range and give myself \\nthree arrows to get the job done. I place my feet \\ncarefully, block out the rest of the world as I take \\nmeticulous aim, The first arrow tears through the side \\nof the bag near the top, leaving a split in the burlap. \\nThe second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the \\nfirst apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, \\ncatching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from \\nthe bag. \\n\\nFor a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then \\nthe apples spill to the ground and I\\'m blown \\nbackward into the air. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain \\nknocks the wind out of me. My backpack does little to \\nsoften the blow. Fortunately my quiver has caught in \\nthe crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my \\nshoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp. The \\nground still shakes with explosions. I can\\'t hear them. \\nI can\\'t hear anything at the moment. But the apples \\nmust have set off enough mines, causing debris to \\nactivate the others. I manage to shield my face with \\nmy arms as shattered bits of matter, some of it \\nburning, rain down around me. An acrid smoke fills \\nthe air, which is not the best remedy for someone \\ntrying to regain the ability to breathe. \\n\\nAfter about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I \\nroll on my side and allow myself a moment of \\nsatisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that \\nwas recently the pyramid. The Careers aren\\'t likely to \\nsalvage anything out of that. \\n\\nI\\'d better get out of here, I think. They \\'11 be making a \\nbeeline for the place. But once I\\'m on my feet, I realize \\nescape may not be so simple. I\\'m dizzy. Not the \\nslightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the \\ntrees swooping around you and causes the earth to \\nmove in waves under your feet. \\n\\nI take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands \\nand knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it \\ndoesn\\'t. \\n\\nPanic begins to set in. I can\\'t stay here. Flight is \\nessential. But I can neither walk nor hear. I place a \\nhand to my left ear, the one that was turned toward \\nthe blast, and it comes away bloody. Have I gone deaf \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the explosion? The idea frightens me. I rely as \\nmuch on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe \\nmore at times. But I can\\'t let my fear show. \\nAbsolutely, positively, I am live on every screen in \\nPanem. \\n\\nNo blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my \\nhood up over my head, tie the cord under my chin \\nwith uncooperative fingers. That should help soak up \\nthe blood. I can\\'t walk, but can I crawl? I move \\nforward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly, I can \\ncrawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. \\nMy only hope is to make it back to Rue\\'s copse and \\nconceal myself in greenery. I can\\'t get caught out here \\non my hands and knees in the open. Not only will I \\nface death, it\\'s sure to be a long and painful one at \\nCato\\'s hand. The thought of Prim having to watch \\nthat keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the \\nhideout. \\n\\nAnother blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray \\nmine, set off by some collapsing crate. This happens \\ntwice more. I\\'m reminded of those last few kernels \\nthat burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at \\nhome. \\n\\nTo say I make it in the nick of time is an \\nunderstatement. I have literally just dragged myself \\ninto the tangle of hushes at the base of the trees \\nwhen there\\'s Cato, barreling onto the plain, soon \\nfollowed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it \\nmight be comical \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so people really do tear out their \\nhair and beat the ground with their fists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if I didn\\'t \\nknow that it was aimed at me, at what I have done to \\nhim. Add to that my proximity, my inability to run or \\ndefend myself, and in fact, the whole thing has me \\nterrified. I\\'m glad my hiding place makes it impossible \\nfor the cameras to get a close shot of me because I\\'m \\nbiting my nails like there\\'s no tomorrow. Gnawing off \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthe last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth \\nfrom chattering. \\n\\nThe boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins \\nand must have declared all the mines activated \\nbecause the Careers are approaching the wreckage. \\n\\nCato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and \\ntakes out his anger on the smoking remains by \\nkicking open various containers. The other tributes \\nare poking around in the mess, looking for anything \\nto salvage, but there\\'s nothing. The boy from District \\n3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur to \\nCato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears \\nto be shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only \\nhas time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a \\nheadlock from behind. I can see the muscles ripple in \\nCato\\'s arms as he sharply jerks the boy\\'s head to the \\nside. \\n\\nIt\\'s that quick. The death of the boy from District 3. \\n\\nThe other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato \\ndown. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but \\nthey keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until \\nI realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the \\nexplosions is dead. \\n\\nThey don\\'t know about the arrows and the apples. \\nThey assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the \\ntribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If \\nthere was a cannon shot, it could have been easily \\nlost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered \\nremains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They \\nretire to the far side of the lake to allow the \\nGamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from \\nDistrict 3. And they wait. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and \\ntakes the dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. \\nNight falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the \\nanthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. \\nThey show the boy from District 3. They show the boy \\nfrom District 10, who must have died this morning. \\nThen the seal reappears. So, now they know. The \\nbomber survived. In the seal\\'s light, I can see Cato \\nand the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision \\nglasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a tree branch \\nfor a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all \\ntheir faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to \\nhunt. \\n\\nThe dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is \\nstill deafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which \\nseems a good sign. There\\'s no point in leaving my \\nhiding place, though. I\\'m about as safe as I can be, \\nhere at the crime scene. They probably think the \\nbomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. Still \\nit\\'s a long time before I risk moving. \\n\\nThe first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put \\nthem on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least \\none of my hunter\\'s senses working. I drink some \\nwater and wash the blood from my ear. Fearing the \\nsmell of meat will draw unwanted predators \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fresh \\nblood is bad enough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I make a good meal out of the \\ngreens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered \\ntoday. \\n\\nWhere is my little ally? Did she make it back to the \\nrendezvous point? Is she worried about me? At least, \\nthe sky has shown we\\'re both alive. \\n\\nI run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. \\nThe boy from 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 1 1 \\nand 12. Just eight of us. The betting must be getting \\nreally hot in the Capitol. They\\'ll be doing special \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfeatures on each of us now. Probably interviewing our \\nfriends and families. It\\'s been a long time since a \\ntribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. \\nAnd now there are two of us. Although from what \\nCato said, Peeta\\'s on his way out. Not that Cato is the \\nfinal word on anything. Didn\\'t he just lose his entire \\nstash of supplies? \\n\\nLet the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I \\nthink. Let them begin for real. \\n\\nA cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping \\nbag before I remember I left it with Rue. I was \\nsupposed to pick up another one, but what with the \\nmines and all, I forgot. I begin to shiver. Since \\nroosting overnight in a tree isn\\'t sensible anyway, I \\nscoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover \\nmyself with leaves and pine needles. I\\'m still freezing. \\nI lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and \\nposition my backpack to block the wind. It\\'s a little \\nbetter. I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from \\nDistrict 8 that lit the fire that first night. But now it\\'s \\nme who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until \\nmorning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my \\narms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my \\nchest. Somehow, I drift off to sleep. \\n\\nWhen I open my eyes, the world looks slightly \\nfractured, and it takes a minute to realize that the \\nsun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my \\nvision. As I sit up and remove them, I hear a laugh \\nsomewhere near the lake and freeze. The laugh\\'s \\ndistorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I \\nmust be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can \\nhear again, although it\\'s still ringing. As for my left \\near, well, at least the bleeding has stopped. \\n\\nI peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have \\nreturned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nit\\'s Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid \\nand laughing. She\\'s smarter than the Careers, \\nactually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A \\nmetal pot. A knife blade. I\\'m perplexed by her \\namusement until I realize that with the Careers\\' \\nstores eliminated, she might actually stand a chance. \\nJust like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal \\nmyself and enlist her as a second ally against that \\npack. But I rule it out. There\\'s something about that \\nsly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface \\nwould ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that \\nin mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. \\nBut she\\'s heard something, not me, because her head \\nturns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for \\nthe woods. I wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if \\nFoxface thought it was dangerous, maybe it\\'s time for \\nme to get out of here, too. Besides, I\\'m eager to tell \\nRue about the pyramid. \\n\\nSince I\\'ve no idea where the Careers are, the route \\nback by the stream seems as good as any. I hurry, \\nloaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold groosling in \\nthe other, because I\\'m famished now, and not just for \\nleaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the \\nmeat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once \\nthere, I refill my water and wash, taking particular \\ncare with my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using \\nthe stream as a guide. At one point, I find boot prints \\nin the mud along the bank. The Careers have been \\nhere, but not for a while. The prints are deep because \\nthey were made in soft mud, but now they\\'re nearly \\ndry in the hot sun. I haven\\'t been careful enough \\nabout my own tracks, counting on a light tread and \\nthe pine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off \\nmy boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the \\nstream. \\n\\nThe cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, \\nmy spirits. I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow- \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nmoving stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even \\nthough I\\'ve just had the groosling. The second I\\'ll save \\nfor Rue. \\n\\nGradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear \\ndiminishes until it\\'s gone entirely. I find myself \\npawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean \\naway whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds. If \\nthere\\'s improvement, it\\'s undetectable. I can\\'t adjust \\nto deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced \\nand defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps \\nturning to the injured side, as my right ear tries to \\ncompensate for the wall of nothingness where \\nyesterday there was a constant flow of information. \\nThe more time that passes, the less hopeful I am that \\nthis is an injury that will heal. \\n\\nWhen I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel \\ncertain it\\'s been undisturbed. There\\'s no sign of Rue, \\nnot on the ground or in the trees. This is odd. By now \\nshe should have returned, as it\\'s midday. \\nUndoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree \\nsomewhere. What else could she do with no light and \\nthe Careers with their night-vision glasses tramping \\naround the woods. And the third fire she was \\nsupposed to set \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although I forgot to check for it \\nlast night \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was the farthest from our site of all. \\nShe\\'s probably just being cautious about making her \\nway back. I wish she\\'d hurry, because I don\\'t want to \\nhang around here too long. I want to spend the \\nafternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we \\ngo. But there\\'s nothing really for me to do but wait. \\n\\nI wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean \\nmy ever-growing list of wounds. The burns are much \\nbetter but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway. \\nThe main thing to worry about now is keeping out \\ninfection. I go ahead and eat the second fish. It isn\\'t \\ngoing to last long in this hot sun, but it should be \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\neasy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she would \\njust show up. \\n\\nFeeling too vulnerable on the ground with my \\nlopsided hearing, I scale a tree to wait. If the Careers \\nshow up, this will be a fine place to shoot them from. \\nThe sun moves slowly. I do things to pass the time. \\nChew leaves and apply them to my stings that are \\ndeflated but still tender. Comb through my damp hair \\nwith my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back up. \\nCheck over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test \\nmy left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf \\nnear it, but without good results. \\n\\nDespite the groosling and the fish, my stomach\\'s \\ngrowling, and I know I\\'m going to have what we call a \\nhollow day back in District 12. That\\'s a day where no \\nmatter what you put in your belly, it\\'s never enough. \\nHaving nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse, \\nso I decide to give into it. After all, I\\'ve lost a lot of \\nweight in the arena, I need some extra calories. And \\nhaving the bow and arrows makes me far more \\nconfident about my future prospects. \\n\\nI slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last \\ncracker. The groosling neck. That\\'s good because it \\ntakes time to pick clean. Finally, a groosling wing and \\nthe bird is history. But it\\'s a hollow day, and even \\nwith all that I start daydreaming about food. \\nParticularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. \\nThe chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and \\npudding. Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. \\nThe lamb and dried plum stew. I suck on a few mint \\nleaves and tell myself to get over it. Mint is good \\nbecause we drink mint tea after supper often, so it \\ntricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. \\nSort of. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nDangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a \\nmouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand . . . this \\nis the most relaxed I\\'ve been since I\\'ve entered the \\narena. If only Rue would show up, and we could clear \\nout. As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. \\nBy late afternoon, I\\'ve resolved to go looking for her. I \\ncan at least visit the spot where she set the third fire \\nand see if there are any clues to her whereabouts. \\n\\nBefore I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old \\ncamp fire. Since we gathered these some distance \\naway, Rue will understand I\\'ve been here, while they\\'ll \\nmean nothing to the Careers. \\n\\nIn less than an hour, I\\'m at the place where we agreed \\nto have the third fire and I know something has gone \\namiss. The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly \\ninterspersed with tinder, but it has never been lit. \\nRue set up the fire but never made it back here. \\nSomewhere between the second column of smoke I \\nspied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she \\nran into trouble. \\n\\nI have to remind myself she\\'s still alive. Or is she? \\nCould the cannon shot announcing her death have \\ncome in the wee hours of the morning when even my \\ngood ear was too broken to pick it up? Will she \\nappear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to believe it. \\nThere could be a hundred other explanations. She \\ncould have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators \\nor another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. \\nWhatever happened, I\\'m almost certain she\\'s stuck \\nout there, somewhere between the second fire and the \\nunlit one at my feet. Something is keeping her up a \\ntree. \\n\\nI think I\\'ll go hunt it down. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a relief to be doing something after sitting around \\nall afternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, \\nletting them conceal me. But nothing seems \\nsuspicious. There\\'s no sign of any kind of struggle, no \\ndisruption of the needles on the ground. I\\'ve stopped \\nfor just a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my \\nhead around to the side to be sure, but there it is \\nagain. Rue\\'s four-note tune coming out of a \\nmockingj ay\\'s mouth. The one that means she\\'s all \\nright. \\n\\nI grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another \\njust a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful \\nof notes. Rue has been singing to them, and recently. \\nOtherwise they\\'d have taken up some other song. My \\neyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of her. I \\nswallow and sing softly back, hoping she\\'ll know it\\'s \\nsafe to join me. A mockingj ay repeats the melody to \\nme. And that\\'s when I hear the scream. \\n\\nIt\\'s a child\\'s scream, a young girl\\'s scream, there\\'s no \\none in the arena capable of making that sound except \\nRue. And now I\\'m running, knowing this may be a \\ntrap, knowing the three Careers may be poised to \\nattack me, but I can\\'t help myself. There\\'s another \\nhigh-pitched cry, this time my name. \"Katniss! \\nKatniss!\" \\n\\n\"Rue!\" I shout back, so she knows I\\'m near. So, they \\nknow I\\'m near, and hopefully the girl who has \\nattacked them with tracker j ackers and gotten an \\neleven they still can\\'t explain will be enough to pull \\ntheir attention away from her. \"Rue! I\\'m coming!\" \\n\\nWhen I break into the clearing, she\\'s on the ground, \\nhopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to \\nreach her hand through the mesh and say my name \\nbefore the spear enters her body. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the \\nspear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his \\nneck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief \\nremainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and \\ndrowning in his own blood. I\\'m reloaded, shifting my \\naim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, \"Are there \\nmore? Are there more?\" \\n\\nShe has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue \\nhas rolled to her side, her body curved in and around \\nthe spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out \\nmy knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the \\nwound and I know it\\'s far beyond my capacity to heal, \\nbeyond anyone\\'s probably. The spearhead is buried \\nup to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, \\nstaring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There\\'s \\nno point in comforting words, in telling her she\\'ll be \\nall right. She\\'s no fool. Her hand reaches out and I \\nclutch it like a lifeline. As if it\\'s me who\\'s dying \\ninstead of Rue. \\n\\n\"You blew up the food?\" she whispers. \\n\\n\"Every last bit,\" I say. \\n\\n\"You have to win,\" she says. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to. Going to win for both of us now,\" I \\npromise. I hear a cannon and look up. It must be for \\nthe boy from District 1 . \\n\\n\"Don\\'t go.\" Rue tightens her grip on my hand. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Course not. Staying right here,\" I say. I move in \\ncloser to her, pulling her head onto my lap. I gently \\nbrush the dark, thick hair back behind her ear. \\n\\n\"Sing,\" she says, but I barely catch the word. \\n\\nSing? I think. Sing what?I do know a few songs. \\nBelieve it or not, there was once music in my house, \\ntoo. Music I helped make. My father pulled me in with \\nthat remarkable voice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but I haven\\'t sung much \\nsince he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then I \\nsing her the same songs she liked as a baby. \\n\\nSing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke \\nand fatigue. But if this is Prim\\'s, I mean, Rue\\'s last \\nrequest, I have to at least try. The song that comes to \\nme is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry \\nbabies to sleep with, It\\'s old, very old I think. Made up \\nlong ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a \\nmountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, \\npromising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this \\nawful piece of time we call today. \\n\\nI give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin: \\n\\nDeep in the meadow, under the willow \\n\\nA bed of grass, a soft green pillow \\n\\nLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyes \\n\\nAnd when again they open, the sun will rise. \\n\\nHere it\\'s safe, here it\\'s warm \\n\\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm \\n\\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings \\nthem true \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHere is the place where I love you. \\n\\nRue\\'s eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but \\nonly slightly. My throat releases the tears and they \\nslide down my cheeks. But I have to finish the song \\nfor her. \\n\\nDeep in the meadow, hidden far away \\n\\nA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray \\n\\nForget your woes and let your troubles lay \\n\\nAnd when again it\\'s morning, they\\'ll wash away. \\n\\nHere it\\'s safe, here it\\'s warm \\n\\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm \\n\\nThe final lines are barely audible. \\n\\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings \\nthem true \\n\\nHere is the place where I love you. \\n\\nEverything\\'s still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the \\nmockingj ays take up my song. \\n\\nFor a moment, I sit there, watching my tears drip \\ndown on her face. Rue\\'s cannon fires. I lean forward \\nand press my lips against her temple. Slowly, as if not \\nto wake her, I lay her head back on the ground and \\nrelease her hand. \\n\\nThey\\'ll want me to clear out now. So they can collect \\nthe bodies. And there\\'s nothing to stay for. I roll the \\nboy from District 1 onto his face and take his pack, \\nretrieve the arrow that ended his life. I cut Rue\\'s pack \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom her back as well, knowing she\\'d want me to have \\nit but leave the spear in her stomach. Weapons in \\nbodies will be transported to the hovercraft. I\\'ve no \\nuse for a spear, so the sooner it\\'s gone from the arena \\nthe better. \\n\\nI can\\'t stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby \\nanimal curled up in a nest of netting. I can\\'t bring \\nmyself to leave her like this. Past harm, but seeming \\nutterly defenseless. To hate the boy from District 1, \\nwho also appears so vulnerable in death, seems \\ninadequate. It\\'s the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all \\nof us. \\n\\nGale\\'s voice is in my head. His ravings against the \\nCapitol no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. \\nRue\\'s death has forced me to confront my own fury \\nagainst the cruelty, the injustice they inflict upon us. \\nBut here, even more strongly than at home, I feel my \\nimpotence. There\\'s no way to take revenge on the \\nCapitol. Is there? \\n\\nThen I remember Peeta\\'s words on the roof. \"Only I \\nkeep wishing I could think of a way to ... to show the \\nCapital they don\\'t own me. That I\\'m more than just a \\npiece in their Games.\" And for the first time, I \\nunderstand what he means. \\n\\nI want to do something, right here, right now, to \\nshame them, to make them accountable, to show the \\nCapitol that whatever they do or force us to do there \\nis a part of every tribute they can\\'t own. That Rue was \\nmore than a piece in their Games. And so am I. \\n\\nA few steps into the woods grows a bank of \\nwildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some \\nsort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of \\nviolet and yellow and white. I gather up an armful \\nand come back to Rue\\'s side. Slowly, one stem at a \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ntime, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the \\nugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair \\nwith bright colors. \\n\\nThey\\'ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn \\nthe cameras elsewhere at this moment, theyll have to \\nbring them back when they collect the bodies and \\neveryone will see her then and know I did it. I step \\nback and take a last look at Rue. She could really be \\nasleep in that meadow after all. \\n\\n\"Bye, Rue,\" I whisper. I press the three middle fingers \\nof my left hand against my lips and hold them out in \\nher direction. Then I walk away without looking back. \\n\\nThe birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives \\nthe warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I \\ndon\\'t know how it knows. It must hear things that \\nhumans can\\'t. I pause, my eyes focused on what\\'s \\nahead, not what\\'s happening behind me. It doesn\\'t \\ntake long, then the general birdsong begins again and \\nI know she\\'s gone. \\n\\nAnother mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, \\nlands on a branch before me and bursts out Rue\\'s \\nmelody. \\n\\nMy song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this \\nnovice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of \\nnotes. The ones that mean she\\'s safe. \\n\\n\"Good and safe,\" I say as I pass under its branch. \"We \\ndon\\'t have to worry about her now.\" Good and safe. \\n\\nI\\'ve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had \\nthat one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander \\nthis way and that until sunset. I\\'m not afraid, not \\neven watchful. Which makes me an easy target. \\nExcept I\\'d kill anyone I met on sight. Without emotion \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nor the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred of the \\nCapitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors \\nin the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, \\ncan be made to pay for Rue\\'s death. \\n\\nNo one materializes though. There aren\\'t many of us \\nleft and it\\'s a big arena. Soon they\\'ll be pulling out \\nsome other device to force us together. But there\\'s \\nbeen enough gore today. Perhaps we\\'ll even get to \\nsleep. \\n\\nI\\'m about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp \\nwhen a silver parachute floats down and lands in \\nfront of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now? I\\'ve \\nbeen in fairly good shape with supplies. Maybe \\nHaymitch\\'s noticed my despondency and is trying to \\ncheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to help \\nmy ear? \\n\\nI open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread \\nIt\\'s not the fine white Capitol stuff. It\\'s made of dark \\nration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with \\nseeds. I flash back to Peeta\\'s lesson on the various \\ndistrict breads in the Training Center. This bread \\ncame from District 1 1 . I cautiously lift the still warm \\nloaf. What must it have cost the people of District 1 1 \\nwho can\\'t even feed themselves? How many would Ve \\nhad to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the \\ncollection for this one loaf? It had been meant for \\nRue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she \\ndied, they\\'d authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a \\nthank-you? Or because, like me, they don\\'t like to let \\ndebts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. \\nA district gift to a tribute who\\'s not your own. \\n\\nI lift my face and step into the last falling rays of \\nsunlight. \"My thanks to the people of District Eleven,\" \\nI say. I want them to know I know where it came \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom. That the full value of their gift has been \\nrecognized. \\n\\nI climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but \\nto get as far away from today as I can. My sleeping \\nbag is rolled neatly in Rue\\'s pack. Tomorrow I\\'ll sort \\nthrough the supplies. Tomorrow I\\'ll make a new plan. \\nBut tonight, all I can do is strap myself in and take \\ntiny bites of the bread. It\\'s good. It tastes of home. \\n\\nSoon the seal\\'s in the sky, the anthem plays in my \\nright ear. I see the boy from District 1, Rue. That\\'s all \\nfor tonight. Six of us left, I think. Only six. With the \\nbread still locked in my hands, I fall asleep at once. \\n\\nSometimes when things are particularly bad, my \\nbrain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my \\nfather in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake \\nwith Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in \\nher flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to \\nteach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of \\nher wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She \\nsings songs I\\'ve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. \\nOn and on. Through the night. There\\'s a drowsy in- \\nbetween period when I can hear the last few strains of \\nher music although she\\'s lost in the leaves. When I \\nfully awaken, I\\'m momentarily comforted. I try to hold \\non to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly \\nslips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever. \\n\\nHeaviness infuses my whole body, as if there\\'s liquid \\nlead in my veins. I\\'ve lost the will to do the simplest \\ntasks, to do anything but lie here, staring \\nunblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For \\nseveral hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it\\'s the \\nthought of Prim\\'s anxious face as she watches me on \\nthe screens back home that breaks me from my \\nlethargy. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI give myself a series of simple commands to follow, \\nlike \"Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have \\nto drink water, Katniss.\" I act on the orders with slow, \\nrobotic motions. \"Now you have to sort the packs, \\nKatniss.\" \\n\\nRue\\'s pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty \\nwater skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of \\nrabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy \\nfrom District 1 has several knives, two spare \\nspearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a \\nfirst-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried \\nfruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have \\nchosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme \\narrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have \\nsuch a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your \\nenemies so quickly you\\'ll be home before you\\'re \\nhungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so \\nlightly when it came to food and now find themselves \\nwith nothing. \\n\\nSpeaking of which, my own supply is running low. I \\nfinish off the loaf from District 1 1 and the last of the \\nrabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left \\nare Rue\\'s roots and nuts, the boy\\'s dried fruit, and \\none strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss, I tell \\nmyself. \\n\\nI obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my \\npack. After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy\\'s \\nknives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no \\none else can use them. I\\'ve lost my bearings what \\nwith all the wandering around I did yesterday \\nevening, but I try and head back in the general \\ndirection of the stream. I know I\\'m on course when I \\ncome across Rue\\'s third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, \\nI discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees \\nand take out three before they know what hit them. I \\nreturn to Rue\\'s signal fire and start it up, not caring \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nabout the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato? I \\nthink as I roast the birds and Rue\\'s roots. I\\'m waiting \\nright here. \\n\\nWho knows where the Careers are now? Either too far \\nto reach me or too sure this is a trick or ... is it \\npossible? Too scared of me? They know I have the \\nbow and arrows, of course, Cato saw me take them \\nfrom Glimmer\\'s body, but have they put two and two \\ntogether yet? Figured out I blew up the supplies and \\nkilled their fellow Career? Possibly they think Thresh \\ndid this. Wouldn\\'t he be more likely to revenge Rue\\'s \\ndeath than I would? Being from the same district? Not \\nthat he ever took any interest in her. \\n\\nAnd what about Foxface? Did she hang around to \\nwatch me blow up the supplies? No. When I caught \\nher laughing in the ashes the next morning, it was as \\nif someone had given her a lovely surprise. \\n\\nI doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Cato\\'s \\nsure he\\'s as good as dead. I find myself wishing I \\ncould tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue. That I \\nnow understand what he was trying to say on the \\nroof. Perhaps if he wins the Games, he\\'ll see me on \\nvictor\\'s night, when they replay the highlights of the \\nGames on a screen over the stage where we did our \\ninterviews. The winner sits in a place of honor on the \\nplatform, surrounded by their support crew. \\n\\nBut I told Rue I\\'d be there. For both of us. And \\nsomehow that seems even more important than the \\nvow I gave Prim. \\n\\nI really think I stand a chance of doing it now. \\nWinning. It\\'s not just having the arrows or \\noutsmarting the Careers a few times, although those \\nthings help. Something happened when I was holding \\nRue\\'s hand, watching the life drain out of her. Now I \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nam determined to revenge her, to make her loss \\nunforgettable, and I can only do that by winning and \\nthereby making myself unforgettable. \\n\\nI overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to \\nshoot, but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are \\nout there beating one another senseless. Which would \\nbe fine, Ever since the bloodbath, I\\'ve been featured \\non screens most than I care. \\n\\nEventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the \\nstream to replenish my water and gather some. But \\nthe heaviness from the morning drapes back over me \\nand even though it\\'s only early evening, I climb a tree \\nand settle in for the night. My brain begins to replay \\nthe events from yesterday. I keep seeing Rue speared, \\nmy arrow piercing the boy\\'s neck. I don\\'t know why I \\nshould even care about the boy. \\n\\nThen I realize ... he was my first kill. \\n\\nAlong with other statistics they report to help people \\nplace their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I \\nguess technically I\\'d get credited for Glimmer and the \\ngirl from District 4, too, for dumping that nest on \\nthem. But the boy from District 1 was the first person \\nI knew would die because of my actions. Numerous \\nanimals have lost their lives at my hands, but only \\none human. I hear Gale saying, \"How different can it \\nbe, really?\" \\n\\nAmazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an \\narrow shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed \\na boy whose name I don\\'t even know. Somewhere his \\nfamily is weeping for him. His friends call for my \\nblood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed \\nhe would come back . . . \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBut then I think of Rue\\'s still body and I\\'m able to \\nbanish the boy from my mind. At least, for now. \\n\\nIt\\'s been an uneventful day according to the sky. No \\ndeaths. I wonder how long well get until the next \\ncatastrophe drives us back together. If it\\'s going to be \\ntonight, I want to get some sleep first. I cover my good \\near to block out the strains of the anthem, but then I \\nhear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation. \\n\\nFor the most part, the only communication the \\ntributes get from outside the arena is the nightly \\ndeath toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets \\nfollowed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a \\ncall to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers \\nwill invite the players to a banquet, somewhere \\nknown to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement \\nto gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and \\nsometimes there\\'s nothing but a loaf of stale bread for \\nthe tributes to compete for. I wouldn\\'t go in for the \\nfood, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few \\ncompetitors. \\n\\nClaudius Templesmith\\'s voice booms down from \\noverhead, congratulating the six of us who remain. \\nBut he is not inviting us to a feast. He\\'s saying \\nsomething very confusing. There\\'s been a rule change \\nin the Games. A rule change! That in itself is mind \\nbending since we don\\'t really have any rules to speak \\nof except don\\'t step off your circle for sixty seconds \\nand the unspoken rule about not eating one another. \\nUnder the new rule, both tributes from the same \\ndistrict will be declared winners if they are the last \\ntwo alive. Claudius pauses, as if he knows we\\'re not \\ngetting it, and repeats the change again. \\n\\nThe news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If \\nthey\\'re from the same district. Both can live. Both of \\nus can live. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore I can stop myself, I call out Peeta\\'s name. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPART III \\n\"THE VICTOR\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has \\nalready escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a \\nchorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! I tell \\nmyself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, frozen, for \\nthe woods to come alive with assailants. Then I \\nremember there\\'s almost no one left. \\n\\nPeeta, who\\'s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever \\ndoubts I\\'ve had about him dissipate because if either \\nof us took the other\\'s life now we\\'d be pariahs when \\nwe returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was \\nwatching I\\'d loathe any tribute who didn\\'t \\nimmediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it \\njust makes sense to protect each other. And in my \\ncase \\xe2\\x80\\x94 being one of the star-crossed lovers from \\nDistrict 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s an absolute requirement if I want \\nany more help from sympathetic sponsors. \\n\\nThe star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been \\nplaying that angle all along. Why else would the \\nGamemakers have made this unprecedented change \\nin the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at \\nwinning, our \"romance\" must be so popular with the \\naudience that condemning it would jeopardize the \\nsuccess of the Games. No thanks to me. All I\\'ve done \\nis managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he\\'s done \\nin the arena, he must have the audience convinced it \\nwas to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me \\nfrom running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let \\nme escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must \\nhave been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, \\nhas never been a danger to me. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and \\nhold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can \\nbe sure to catch it. \\n\\nSo, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy \\ntribute from her district is dead. She\\'s operating \\nalone, at night. And her strategy has been to evade, \\nnot attack. I don\\'t really think that, even if she heard \\nmy voice, she\\'d do anything but hope someone else \\nwould kill me. \\n\\nThen there\\'s Thresh. All right, he\\'s a distinct threat. \\nBut I haven\\'t seen him, not once, since the Games \\nbegan. I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when \\nshe heard a sound at the site of the explosion. But \\nshe didn\\'t turn to the Woods, she turned to whatever \\nlies across from it. To that area of the arena that \\ndrops off into I don\\'t know what. I feel almost certain \\nthat the person she ran from was Thresh and that is \\nhis domain. He\\'d never have heard me from there \\nand, even if he did, I\\'m up too high for someone his \\nsize to reach. \\n\\nSo that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who \\nare now surely celebrating the new rule. They\\'re the \\nonly ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and \\nmyself. Do I run from them now, on the chance they \\nheard me call Peeta\\'s name?No,I think. Let them \\ncome. Let them come with their night-vision glasses \\nand their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. \\n\\nRight into the range of my arrows. But I know they \\nwon\\'t. If they didn\\'t come in daylight to my fire, they \\nwon\\'t risk what could be another trap at night. When \\nthey come, it will be on their own terms, not because \\nI\\'ve let them know my whereabouts. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nStay put and get some sleep, Katniss,I instruct \\nmyself, although I wish I could start tracking Peeta \\nnow. Tomorrow, you\\'ll find him. \\n\\nI do sleep, but in the morning I\\'m extra- cautious, \\nthinking that while the Careers might hesitate to \\nattack me in a tree, they\\'re completely capable of \\nsetting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully \\nprepare myself for the day \\xe2\\x80\\x94 eating a big breakfast, \\nsecuring my pack, readying my weapons \\xe2\\x80\\x94 before I \\ndescend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on \\nthe ground. \\n\\nToday 111 have to be scrupulously careful. The \\nCareers will know I\\'m trying to locate Peeta. They may \\nwell want to wait until I do before they move in. If he\\'s \\nas badly wounded as Cato thinks, I\\'d be in the \\nposition of having to defend us both without any \\nassistance. But if he\\'s that incapacitated, how has he \\nmanaged to stay alive? And how on earth will I find \\nhim? \\n\\nI try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might \\ngive me an indication as to where he\\'s hiding out, but \\nnothing rings a bell. So I go back to the last moment I \\nsaw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to \\nrun. Then Cato appeared, his sword drawn. And after \\nI was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did Peeta get \\naway? Maybe he\\'d held out better against the tracker \\nj acker poison than Cato. \\n\\nMaybe that was the variable that allowed him to \\nescape. But he\\'d been stung, too. So how far could he \\nhave gotten, stabbed and filled with venom? And how \\nhas he stayed alive all these days since? If the wound \\nand the stingers haven\\'t killed him, surely thirst \\nwould have taken him by now. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when I get my first clue to his \\nwhereabouts. He couldn\\'t have survived without \\nwater. I know that from my first few days here. He \\nmust be hidden somewhere near a source. There\\'s the \\nlake, but I find that an unlikely option since it\\'s so \\nclose to the Careers\\' base camp. A few spring-fed \\npools. But you\\'d really be a sitting duck at one of \\nthose. And the stream. The one that leads from the \\ncamp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake \\nand beyond. If he stuck to the stream, he could \\nchange his location and always be near water. He \\ncould walk in the current and erase any tracks. He \\nmight even be able to get a fish or two. \\n\\nWell, it\\'s a place to start, anyway. \\n\\nTo confuse my enemies\\' minds, I start a fire with \\nplenty of green wood. Even if they think it\\'s a ruse, I \\nhope they\\'ll decide I\\'m hidden somewhere near it. \\nWhile in reality, I\\'ll be tracking Peeta. \\n\\nThe sun burns off the morning haze almost \\nimmediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than \\nusual. The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet \\nas I head downstream. I\\'m tempted to call out Peeta\\'s \\nname as I go but decide against it. I will have to find \\nhim with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to \\nfind me. But he\\'ll know 111 be looking, right? He won\\'t \\nhave so low of an opinion of me as to think I\\'d ignore \\nthe new rule and keep to myself. Would he? He\\'s very \\nhard to predict, which might be interesting under \\ndifferent circumstances, but at the moment only \\nprovides an extra obstacle. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t take long to reach the spot where I peeled \\noff to go the Careers\\' camp. There\\'s been no sign of \\nPeeta, but this doesn\\'t surprise me. I\\'ve been up and \\ndown this stretch three times since the tracker jacker \\nincident. If he were nearby, surely I\\'d have had some \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nsuspicion of it. The stream begins to curve to the left \\ninto a part of the woods that\\'s new to me. Muddy \\nbanks covered in tangled water plants lead to large \\nrocks that increase in size until I begin to feel \\nsomewhat trapped. It would be no small matter to \\nescape the stream now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as \\nI climbed over this rocky terrain. In fact, I\\'ve just \\nabout decided I\\'m on the wrong track entirely, that a \\nwounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to \\nand from this water source, when I see the bloody \\nstreak going down the curve of a boulder. It\\'s long \\ndried now, but the smeary lines running side to side \\nsuggest someone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who perhaps was not fully in \\ncontrol of his mental faculties \\xe2\\x80\\x94 tried to wipe it away. \\n\\nHugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of \\nthe blood, searching for him. I find a few more \\nbloodstains, one with a few threads of fabric glued to \\nit, but no sign of life. I break down and say his name \\nin a hushed voice. \"Peeta! Peeta!\" Then a mockingjay \\nlands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones \\nso I stop. I give up and climb back down to the stream \\nthinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther \\ndown. \\n\\nMy foot has just broken the surface of the water when \\nI hear a voice. \\n\\n\"You here to finish me off, sweetheart?\" \\n\\nI whip around. It\\'s come from the left, so I can\\'t pick \\nit up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. \\nStill, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena \\nwould call me sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, \\nbut there\\'s nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of \\nthe rocks. \\n\\n\"Peeta?\" I whisper. \"Where are you?\" There\\'s no \\nanswer. Could I just have imagined it? No, I\\'m certain \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nit was real and very close at hand, too. \"Peeta?\" I \\ncreep along the bank. \\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t step on me.\" \\n\\nI jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still \\nthere\\'s nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably \\nblue in the brown mud and green leaves. I gasp and \\nam rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs. \\n\\nIt\\'s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking \\nweights around. Peeta should have gone into his \\nprivate session with the Gamemakers and painted \\nhimself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank \\nfull of weeds. \\n\\n\"Close your eyes again,\" I order. He does, and his \\nmouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what \\nI judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud \\nand plants. His face and arms are so artfully \\ndisguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside him. \"I \\nguess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.\" \\n\\nPeeta smiles. \"Yes, frosting. The final defense of the \\ndying.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re not going to die,\" I tell him firmly. \"Says who?\" \\nHis voice is so ragged. \"Says me. We\\'re on the same \\nteam now, you know,\" I tell him. \\n\\nHis eyes open. \"So, I heard. Nice of you to find what\\'s \\nleft of me.\" \\n\\nI pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. \"Did \\nCato cut you?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Left leg. Up high,\" he answers. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see \\nwhat kind of wounds you\\'ve got,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Lean down a minute first,\" he says. \"Need to tell you \\nsomething.\" I lean over and put my good ear to his \\nlips, which tickle as he whispers. \"Remember, we\\'re \\nmadly in love, so it\\'s all right to kiss me anytime you \\nfeel like it.\" \\n\\nI jerk my head back but end up laughing. \"Thanks, 111 \\nkeep it in mind.\" At least, he\\'s still able to joke \\naround. But when I start to help him to the stream, \\nall the levity disappears. It\\'s only two feet away, how \\nhard can it be? Very hard when I realize he\\'s unable \\nto move an inch on his own. He\\'s so weak that the \\nbest he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but \\ndespite the fact that I know he\\'s doing all he can to \\nkeep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him. The mud \\nand plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally \\nhave to give a gigantic tug to break him from their \\nclutches. He\\'s still two feet from the water, lying \\nthere, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on \\nhis face. \\n\\n\"Look, Peeta, I\\'m going to roll you into the stream. It\\'s \\nvery shallow here, okay?\" I say. \\n\\n\"Excellent,\" he says. \\n\\nI crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, I \\ntell myself, don\\'t stop until he\\'s in the water. \"On \\nthree,\" I say. \"One, two, three!\" I can only manage one \\nfull roll before I have to stop because of the horrible \\nsound he\\'s making. Now he\\'s on the edge of the \\nstream. Maybe this is better anyway. \\n\\n\"Okay, change of plans. I\\'m not going to put you all \\nthe way in,\" I tell him. Besides, if I get him in, who \\nknows if I\\'d ever be able to get him out? \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"No more rolling?\" he asks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s all done. Let\\'s get you cleaned up. Keep an eye \\non the woods for me, okay?\" I say. It\\'s hard to know \\nwhere to start. He so caked with mud and matted \\nleaves, I can\\'t even see his clothes. If he\\'s wearing \\nclothes. The thought makes me hesitate a moment, \\nbut then I plunge in. Naked bodies are no big deal in \\nthe arena, right? \\n\\nI\\'ve got two water bottles and Rue\\'s water skin. I prop \\nthem against rocks in the stream so that two are \\nalways filling while I pour the third over Peeta\\'s body. \\nIt takes a while, but I finally get rid of enough mud to \\nfind his clothes. I gently unzip his jacket, unbutton \\nhis shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt is so \\nplastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with \\nmy knife and drench him again to work it loose. He\\'s \\nbadly bruised with a long burn across his chest and \\nfour tracker j acker stings, if you count the one under \\nhis ear. But I feel a bit better. This much I can fix. I \\ndecide to take care of his upper body first, to alleviate \\nsome pain, before I tackle whatever damage Cato did \\nto his leg. \\n\\nSince treating his wounds seems pointless when he\\'s \\nlying in what\\'s become a mud puddle, I manage to \\nprop him up against a boulder. He sits there, \\nuncomplaining, while I wash away all the traces of \\ndirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is very pale in \\nthe sunlight and he no longer looks strong and \\nstocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker \\njacker lumps, which causes him to wince, but the \\nminute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he \\ndries in the sun, I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and \\nspread them over boulders. Then I apply the burn \\ncream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his \\nskin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of \\nwater have disguised the fact that he\\'s burning with \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nfever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy \\nfrom District 1 and find pills that reduce your \\ntemperature. My mother actually breaks down and \\nbuys these on occasion when her home remedies fail. \\n\\n\"Swallow these,\" I tell him, and he obediently takes \\nthe medicine. \"You must be hungry.\" \\n\\n\"Not really. It\\'s funny, I haven\\'t been hungry for \\ndays,\" says Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, \\nhe wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. That\\'s \\nwhen I know how sick he is. \\n\\n\"Peeta, we need to get some food in you,\" I insist. \\n\\n\"It\\'ll just come right back up,\" he says. The best I can \\ndo is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. \\n\"Thanks. I\\'m much better, really. Can I sleep now, \\nKatniss?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Soon,\" I promise. \"I need to look at your leg \\nfirst. \"Trying to be as gentle as I can, I remove his \\nboots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants \\noff of him. I can see the tear Cato\\'s sword made in the \\nfabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for \\nwhat lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing \\nboth blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst \\nof all, the smell of festering flesh. \\n\\nI want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I \\ndid that day they brought the burn victim to our \\nhouse. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim \\nattend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage \\nto face. But there\\'s no one here but me. I try to \\ncapture the calm demeanor my mother assumes \\nwhen handling particularly bad cases. \\n\\n\"Pretty awful, huh?\" says Peeta. He\\'s watching me \\nclosely. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"So-so.\" I shrug like it\\'s no big deal. \"You should see \\nsome of the people they bring my mother from the \\nmines.\" I refrain from saying how I usually clear out \\nof the house whenever she\\'s treating anything worse \\nthan a cold. Come to think of it, I don\\'t even much \\nlike to be around coughing. \"First thing is to clean it \\nwell.\" \\n\\nI\\'ve left on Peeta\\'s undershorts because they\\'re not in \\nbad shape and I don\\'t want to pull them over the \\nswollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him \\nbeing naked makes me uncomfortable. That\\'s another \\nthing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no \\neffect on them, gives them no cause for \\nembarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the \\nGames, my little sister would be of far more use to \\nPeeta than I am. I scoot my square of plastic under \\nhim so I can wash down the rest of him. With each \\nbottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. \\nThe rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just \\none tracker j acker sting and a few small burns that I \\ntreat quickly. But the gash on his leg ... what on earth \\ncan I do for that? \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t we give it some air and then ...\" I trail off. \\n\\n\"And then youll patch it up?\" says Peeta. He looks \\nalmost sorry for me, as if he knows how lost I am. \\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" I say. \"In the meantime, you eat \\nthese. \"I put a few dried pear halves in his hand and \\ngo back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes. \\nWhen they\\'re flattened out and drying, I examine the \\ncontents of the first-aid kit. It\\'s pretty basic stuff. \\nBandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs. \\nNothing of the caliber I\\'ll need to treat Peeta. \\n\\n\"We\\'re going to have to experiment some,\" I admit. I \\nknow the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nstart with those. Within minutes of pressing the \\nhandful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus \\nbegins running down the side of his leg. I tell myself \\nthis is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek \\nhard because my breakfast is threatening to make a \\nreappearance. \\n\\n\"Katniss?\" Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my \\nface must be some shade of green. He mouths the \\nwords. \"How about that kiss?\" \\n\\nI burst out laughing because the whole thing is so \\nrevolting I can\\'t stand it. \\n\\n\"Something wrong?\" he asks a little too innocently. \\n\\n\"I ... I\\'m no good at this. I\\'m not my mother. I\\'ve no \\nidea what I\\'m doing and I hate pus,\" I say. \"Euh!\" I \\nallow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first \\nround of leaves and apply the second. \"Euuuh!\" \\n\\n\"How do you hunt?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this,\" I \\nsay. \"Although for all I know, I am killing you.\" \\n\\n\"Can you speed it up a little?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"No. Shut up and eat your pears,\" I say. \\n\\nAfter three applications and what seems like a bucket \\nof pus, the wound does look better. Now that the \\nswelling has gone down, I can see how deep Cato\\'s \\nsword cut. Right down to the bone. \\n\\n\"What next, Dr. Everdeen?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Maybe 111 put some of the burn ointment on it. I \\nthink it helps with infection anyway. And wrap it up?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI say. I do and the whole thing seems a lot more \\nmanageable, covered in clean white cotton. Although, \\nagainst the sterile bandage, the hem of his \\nundershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion. I \\npull out Rue\\'s backpack. \"Here, cover yourself with \\nthis and 111 wash your shorts.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t care if you see me,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"You\\'re just like the rest of my family,\" I say. \"I care, \\nall right?\" I turn my back and look at the stream until \\nthe undershorts splash into the current. He must be \\nfeeling a bit better if he can throw. \\n\\n\"You know, you\\'re kind of squeamish for such a lethal \\nperson,\" says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between \\ntwo rocks. \"I wish I\\'d let you give Haymitch a shower \\nafter all.\" \\n\\nI wrinkle my nose at the memory. \"What\\'s he sent you \\nso far?\" \\n\\n\"Not a thing,\" says Peeta. Then there\\'s a pause as it \\nhits him. \"Why, did you get something?\" \\n\\n\"Burn medicine,\" I say almost sheepishly. \"Oh, and \\nsome bread.\" \\n\\n\"I always knew you were his favorite,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Please, he can\\'t stand being in the same room with \\nme, \"I say. \\n\\n\"Because you\\'re just alike,\" mutters Peeta. I ignore it \\nthough because this really isn\\'t the time for me to be \\ninsulting Haymitch, which is my first impulse. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by \\nlate afternoon, I don\\'t dare wait any longer. I gently \\nshake his shoulder. \"Peeta, we\\'ve got to go now.\" \\n\\n\"Go?\" He seems confused. \"Go where?\" \\n\\n\"Away from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we \\ncan hide you until you\\'re stronger,\" I say. I help him \\ndress, leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the \\nwater, and pull him upright. His face drains of color \\nthe moment he puts weight on his leg. \"Come on. You \\ncan do this.\" \\n\\nBut he can\\'t. Not for long anyway. We make it about \\nfifty yards downstream, with him propped up by my \\nshoulder, and I can tell he\\'s going to black out. I sit \\nhim on the bank, push his head between his knees, \\nand pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area. Of \\ncourse, I\\'d love to get him up in a tree, but that\\'s not \\ngoing to happen. It could be worse though. Some of \\nthe rocks form small cavelike structures. I set my \\nsights on one about twenty yards above the stream. \\nWhen Peeta\\'s able to stand, I half-guide, half-carry \\nhim up to the cave. Really, I\\'d like to look around for \\na better place, but this one will have to do because \\nmy ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even \\nthough it\\'s only just cooling off, he\\'s shivering. \\n\\nI cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine \\nneedles, unroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. \\nI get a couple of pills and some water into him when \\nhe\\'s not noticing, but he refuses to eat even the fruit. \\nThen he just lies there, his eyes trained on my face as \\nI build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the \\nmouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An \\nanimal might not question it, but a human would see \\nhands had manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it \\ndown in frustration. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he says. I go over to him and brush the \\nhair back from his eyes. \"Thanks for finding me.\" \\n\\n\"You would have found me if you could,\" I say. His \\nforehead\\'s burning up. Like the medicine\\'s having no \\neffect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I\\'m scared he\\'s \\ngoing to die. \\n\\n\"Yes. Look, if I don\\'t make it back \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he begins. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t talk like that. I didn\\'t drain all that pus for \\nnothing,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I know. But just in case I don\\'t \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he tries to \\ncontinue. \\n\\n\"No, Peeta, I don\\'t even want to discuss it,\" I say, \\nplacing my fingers on his lips to quiet him. \\n\\n\"But I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" he insists. \\n\\nImpulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his \\nwords. This is probably overdue anyway since he\\'s \\nright, we are supposed to be madly in love. It\\'s the \\nfirst time I\\'ve ever kissed a boy, which should make \\nsome sort of impression I guess, but all I can register \\nis how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever. I \\nbreak away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up \\naround him. \"You\\'re not going to die. I forbid it. All \\nright?\" \\n\\n\"All right,\" he whispers. \\n\\nI step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute \\nfloats down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the \\ntie, hoping for some real medicine to treat Peeta\\'s leg. \\nInstead I find a pot of hot broth. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch couldn\\'t be sending me a clearer message. \\nOne kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear \\nhis snarl. \"You\\'re supposed to be in love, sweetheart. \\nThe boy\\'s dying. Give me something I can work with!\" \\n\\nAnd he\\'s right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, I\\'ve got to \\ngive the audience something more to care about. Star- \\ncrossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two \\nhearts beating as one. Romance. \\n\\nNever having been in love, this is going to be a real \\ntrick. I think of my parents. The way my father never \\nfailed to bring her gifts from the woods. The way my \\nmother\\'s face would light up at the sound of his boots \\nat the door. The way she almost stopped living when \\nhe died. \\n\\n\"Peeta!\" I say, trying for the special tone that my \\nmother used only with my father. He\\'s dozed off \\nagain, but I kiss him awake, which seems to startle \\nhim. Then he smiles as if he\\'d be happy to lie there \\ngazing at me forever. He\\'s great at this stuff. \\n\\nI hold up the pot. \"Peeta, look what Haymitch has \\nsent you.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\n\\nGetting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, \\nbegging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip \\nby sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep \\nthen and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a \\nsupper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily \\nreport in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I \\nhave given the audience a fairly interesting day. \\nHopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful \\nnight. \\n\\nI automatically look around for a good tree to nest in \\nbefore I realize that\\'s over. At least for a while. I can\\'t \\nvery well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground. I left \\nthe scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the \\nstream untouched \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how could I conceal it? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and \\nwe\\'re a scant fifty yards downstream. I put on my \\nglasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle \\ndown to keep watch. \\n\\nThe temperature drops rapidly and soon I\\'m chilled to \\nthe bone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the \\nsleeping bag with Peeta. It\\'s toasty warm and I \\nsnuggle down gratefully until I realize it\\'s more than \\nwarm, it\\'s overly hot because the bag is reflecting \\nback his fever. I check his forehead and find it \\nburning and dry. I don\\'t know what to do. Leave him \\nin the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the \\nfever? Take him out and hope the night air cools him \\noff? I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and \\nplacing it on his forehead. It seems weak, but I\\'m \\nafraid to do anything too drastic. \\n\\nI spend the night half- sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, \\nrefreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the \\nfact that by teaming up with him, I\\'ve made myself far \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nmore vulnerable than when I was alone. Tethered to \\nthe ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take \\ncare of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came \\nafter him. I\\'m just going to have to trust that \\nwhatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. \\n\\nWhen the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat \\non Peeta\\'s lip and discover the fever has broken. He\\'s \\nnot back to normal, but it\\'s come down a few degrees. \\nLast night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a \\nbush of Rue\\'s berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it \\nup in the broth pot with cold water. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s struggling to get up when I reach the cave. \"I \\nwoke up and you were gone,\" he says. \"I was worried \\nabout you.\" \\n\\nI have to laugh as I ease him back down. \"You were \\nworried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself \\nlately?\" \\n\\n\"I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. \\nThey like to hunt at night,\" he says, still serious. \\n\\n\"Clove? Which one is that?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"The girl from District Two. She\\'s still alive, right?\"he \\nsays. \\n\\n\"Yes, there\\'s just them and us and Thresh and \\nFoxface,\"I say. \"That\\'s what I nicknamed the girl from \\nFive. How do you feel?\" \\n\\n\"Better than yesterday. This is an enormous \\nimprovement over the mud,\" he says. \"Clean clothes \\nand medicine and a sleeping bag ... and you.\" \\n\\nOh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to \\ntouch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nit against his lips. I remember my father doing this \\nvery thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta \\npicked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch. \\n\\n\"No more kisses for you until you\\'ve eaten,\" I say. \\n\\nWe get him propped up against the wall and he \\nobediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I \\nfeed him. He refuses the groosling again, though. \\n\\n\"You didn\\'t sleep,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"I\\'m all right,\" I say. But the truth is, I\\'m exhausted. \\n\\n\"Sleep now. Ill keep watch. Ill wake you if anything \\nhappens,\" he says. I hesitate. \"Katniss, you can\\'t stay \\nup forever.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s got a point there. I\\'ll have to sleep eventually. \\nAnd probably better to do it now when he seems \\nrelatively alert and we have daylight on our side. \"All \\nright,\" I say. \"But just for a few hours. Then you wake \\nme.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out \\non the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my \\nloaded bow in case I have to shoot at a moment\\'s \\nnotice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, \\nhis bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained \\non the world outside. \"Go to sleep,\" he says softly. His \\nhand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my \\nforehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so \\nfar, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I don\\'t \\nwant him to stop and he doesn\\'t. He\\'s still stroking \\nmy hair when I fall asleep. \\n\\nToo long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I \\nopen my eyes that we\\'re into the afternoon. Peeta\\'s \\nright beside me, his position unchanged. I sit up, \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfeeling somehow defensive but better rested than I\\'ve \\nbeen in days. \\n\\n\"Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple \\nof hours,\" I say. \\n\\n\"For what? Nothing\\'s going on here,\" he says. \\n\"Besides I like watching you sleep. You don\\'t scowl. \\nImproves your looks a lot.\" \\n\\nThis, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him \\ngrin. That\\'s when I notice how dry his lips are. I test \\nhis cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims he\\'s been \\ndrinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give \\nhim more fever pills and stand over him while he \\ndrinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I \\ntend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, \\nwhich are showing improvement. I steel myself and \\nunwrap the leg. \\n\\nMy heart drops into my stomach. It\\'s worse, much \\nworse. There\\'s no more pus in evidence, but the \\nswelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is \\ninflamed. Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl \\nup his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill \\nhim for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment \\nwon\\'t make a dent in it. Well need strong anti- \\ninfection drugs from the Capitol. I can\\'t imagine the \\ncost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled \\nevery donation from every sponsor, would he have \\nenough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the \\nGames continue. What buys a full meal on day one \\nbuys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of \\nmedicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium \\nfrom the beginning. \\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s more swelling, but the pus is gone,\" I \\nsay in an unsteady voice. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,\" says \\nPeeta.\"Even if my mother isn\\'t a healer.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. \\nThey\\'ll cure it back at the Capitol when we win,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s a good plan,\" he says. But I feel this is \\nmostly for my benefit. \\n\\n\"You have to eat. Keep your strength up. I\\'m going to \\nmake you soup,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t light a fire,\" he says. \"It\\'s not worth it.\" \\n\\n\"Well see,\" I say. As I take the pot down to the \\nstream, I\\'m struck by how brutally hot it is. I swear \\nthe Gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the \\ntemperature in the daytime and sending it \\nplummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked \\nstones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe \\nI won\\'t need to light a fire. \\n\\nI settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the \\nstream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of \\nwater, I place it in direct sunlight and add several \\negg- size hot stones to the water. I\\'m the first to admit \\nI\\'m not much of a cook. But since soup mainly \\ninvolves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, it\\'s \\none of my better dishes. I mince groosling until it\\'s \\npractically mush and mash some of Rue\\'s roots. \\nFortunately, they\\'ve both been roasted already so they \\nmostly need to be heated up. Already, between the \\nsunlight and the rocks, the water\\'s warm. I put in the \\nmeat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find \\nsomething green to spice it up a little. Before long, I \\ndiscover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some \\nrocks. Perfect. I chop them very fine and add them to \\nthe pot, switch out the rocks again, put on the lid, \\nand let the whole thing stew. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve seen very few signs of game around, but I don\\'t \\nfeel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt, so I \\nrig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky. I wonder \\nabout the other tributes, how they\\'re managing now \\nthat their main source of food has been blown up. At \\nleast three of them, Cato, Clove, and Foxface, had \\nbeen relying on it. Probably not Thresh though. I\\'ve \\ngot a feeling he must share some of Rue\\'s knowledge \\non how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they \\nfighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of \\nthem has located us and is just waiting for the right \\nmoment to attack. The idea sends me back to the \\ncave. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the \\nshade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when \\nI come in, it\\'s clear he feels miserable. I put cool \\ncloths on his head, but they warm up almost as soon \\nas they touch his skin. \\n\\n\"Do you want anything?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"No,\" he says. \"Thank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story.\" \\n\\n\"A story? What about?\" I say. I\\'m not much for \\nstorytelling. It\\'s kind of like singing. But once in a \\nwhile, Prim wheedles one out of me. \\n\\n\"Something happy. Tell me about the happiest day \\nyou can remember,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nSomething between a sigh and a huff of exasperation \\nleaves my mouth. A happy story? This will require a \\nlot more effort than the soup. I rack my brains for \\ngood memories. Most of them involve Gale and me out \\nhunting and somehow I don\\'t think these will play \\nwell with either Peeta or the audience. That leaves \\nPrim. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did I ever tell you about how I got Prim\\'s goat?\" I \\nask. Peeta shakes his head, and looks at me \\nexpectantly. So I begin. But carefully. Because my \\nwords are going out all over Panem. And while people \\nhave no doubt put two and two together that I hunt \\nillegally, I don\\'t want to hurt Gale or Greasy Sae or \\nthe butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who \\nare my customers by publicly announcing they\\'d \\nbreaking the law, too. \\n\\nHere\\'s the real story of how I got the money for Prim\\'s \\ngoat, Lady. It was a Friday evening, the day before \\nPrim\\'s tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school \\nended, Gale and I hit the woods, because I wanted to \\nget enough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe \\nsome new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our \\nsnares had done well enough and the woods were \\nflush with greens, but this was really no more than \\nour average Friday- night haul. I was disappointed as \\nwe headed back, even though Gale said we\\'d be sure \\nto do better tomorrow. We were resting a moment by \\na stream when we saw him. A young buck, probably a \\nyearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, \\nstill small and coated in velvet. Poised to run but \\nunsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful. \\n\\nLess beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught \\nhim, one in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and \\nI had shot at the same time. The buck tried to run \\nbut stumbled, and Gale\\'s knife slit his throat before \\nhe knew what had happened. Momentarily, I\\'d felt a \\npang at killing something so fresh and innocent. And \\nthen my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that \\nfresh and innocent meat. \\n\\nA deer! Gale and I have only brought down three in \\nall. The first one, a doe that had injured her leg \\nsomehow, almost didn\\'t count. But we knew from that \\nexperience not to go dragging the carcass into the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nHob. It had caused chaos with people bidding on \\nparts and actually trying to hack off pieces \\nthemselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us \\nwith our deer to the butcher, but not before it\\'d been \\nbadly damaged, hunks of meat taken, the hide riddled \\nwith holes. Although everybody paid up fairly, it had \\nlowered the value of the kill. \\n\\nThis time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under \\na hole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though \\nwe were known hunters, it wouldn\\'t have been good \\nto go carrying a 150-pound deer through the streets \\nof District 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the \\nofficials\\' faces. \\n\\nThe butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, \\ncame to the back door when we knocked. You don\\'t \\nhaggle with Rooba. She gives you one price, which \\nyou can take or leave, but it\\'s a fair price. We took her \\noffer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison \\nsteaks we could pick up after the butchering. Even \\nwith the money divided in two, neither Gale nor I had \\nheld so much at one time in our lives. We decided to \\nkeep it a secret and surprise our families with the \\nmeat and money at the end of the next day. \\n\\nThis is where I really got the money for the goat, but I \\ntell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mother\\'s. \\nThat can\\'t hurt anyone. Then I pick up the story in \\nthe late afternoon of Prim\\'s birthday. \\n\\nGale and I went to the market on the square so that I \\ncould buy dress materials. As I was running my \\nfingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, \\nsomething caughtmyeye. There\\'s an old man who \\nkeeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the \\nSeam. I don\\'t know his real name, everyone just calls \\nhim the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted \\nin painful angles, and he\\'s got a hacking cough that \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nproves he spent years in the mines. But he\\'s lucky. \\nSomewhere along the way he saved up enough for \\nthese goats and now has something to do in his old \\nage besides slowly starve to death. He\\'s filthy and \\nimpatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is \\nrich if you can afford it. \\n\\nOne of the goats, a white one with black patches, was \\nlying down in a cart. It was easy to see why. \\nSomething, probably a dog, had mauled her shoulder \\nand infection had set in. It was bad, the Goat Man \\nhad to hold her up to milk her. But I thought I knew \\nsomeone who could fix it. \\n\\n\"Gale,\" I whispered. \"I want that goat for Prim.\" \\n\\nOwning a nanny goat can change your life in District \\n12. The animals can live off almost anything, the \\nMeadow\\'s a perfect feeding place, and they can give \\nfour quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into \\ncheese, to sell. It\\'s not even against the law. \\n\\n\"She\\'s hurt pretty bad,\" said Gale. \"We better take a \\ncloser look.\" \\n\\nWe went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then \\nstood over the goat as if idly curious. \\n\\n\"Let her be,\" said the man. \\n\\n\"Just looking,\" said Gale. \\n\\n\"Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly \\nanyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half \\nprice,\" said the man. \\n\\n\"What\\'s the butcher giving for her?\" I asked. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe man shrugged. \"Hang around and see.\" I turned \\nand saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. \\n\"Lucky thing you showed up,\" said the Goat Man \\nwhen she arrived. \"Girl\\'s got her eye on your goat.\" \\n\\n\"Not if she\\'s spoken for,\" I said carelessly. \\n\\nRooba looked me up and down then frowned at the \\ngoat. \"She\\'s not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half \\nthe carcass will be too rotten for even sausage.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" said the Goat Man. \"We had a deal.\" \\n\\n\"We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. \\nNot that thing. Sell her to the girl if she\\'s stupid \\nenough to take her,\" said Rooba. As she marched off, \\nI caught her wink. \\n\\nThe Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal \\noff his hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the \\nprice. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand \\nout opinions. It was an excellent deal if the goat lived; \\nI\\'d been robbed if she died. People took sides in the \\nargument, but I took the goat. \\n\\nGale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the \\nlook on Prim\\'s face as much as I did. In a moment of \\ncomplete giddiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it \\naround her neck. Then we hurried back to my house. \\n\\nYou should have seen Prim\\'s reaction when we \\nwalked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who \\nwept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was \\nso excited she started crying and laughing all at once. \\nMy mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the \\npair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs \\nand coaxing brews down the animal\\'s throat. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"They sound like you,\" says Peeta. I had almost \\nforgotten he was there. \\n\\n\"Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn\\'t \\nhave died if it tried,\" I say. But then I bite my tongue, \\nrealizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is \\ndying, in my incompetent hands. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not trying,\" he jokes. \"Finish the \\nstory.\" \\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s it. Only I remember that night, Prim \\ninsisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to \\nthe fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat \\nlicked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night \\nkiss or something,\" I say. \"It was already mad about \\nher.\" \\n\\n\"Was it still wearing the pink ribbon?\" he asks. \\n\"I think so,\" I say. \"Why?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m just trying to get a picture,\" he says thoughtfully. \\n\"I can see why that day made you happy.\" \\n\\n\"Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,\" 1 \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting \\njoy you gave the sister you love so much you took her \\nplace in the reaping,\" says Peeta drily. \\n\\n\"The goat has paid for itself. Several times over,\" I say \\nin a superior tone. \\n\\n\"Well, it wouldn\\'t dare do anything else after you \\nsaved its life,\" says Peeta. \"I intend to do the same \\nthing.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Really? What did you cost me again?\" I ask. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"A lot of trouble. Don\\'t worry. You\\'ll get it all back,\"he \\nsays. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not making sense,\" I say. I test his forehead. \\nThe lever\\'s going nowhere but up. \"You\\'re a little \\ncooler though.\" \\n\\nThe sound of the trumpets startles me. I\\'m on my feet \\nand at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting \\nto miss a syllable. It\\'s my new best friend, Claudius \\nTemplesmith, and as I expected, he\\'s inviting us to a \\nfeast. Well, we\\'re not that hungry and I actually wave \\nhis offer away in indifference when he says, \"Now hold \\non. Some of you may already be declining my \\ninvitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you \\nneeds something desperately.\" \\n\\nI do need something desperately. Something to heal \\nPeeta\\'s leg. \\n\\n\"Each of you will find that something in a backpack, \\nmarked with your district number, at the Cornucopia \\nat dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For \\nsome of you, this will be your last chance,\" says \\nClaudius. \\n\\nThere\\'s nothing else, just his words hanging in the \\nair. I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. \\n\"No,\" he says. \"You\\'re not risking your life for me.\" \\n\\n\"Who said I was?\" I say. \\n\\n\"So, you\\'re not going?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Of course, I\\'m not going. Give me some credit. Do \\nyou think I\\'m running straight into some free-for-all \\nagainst Cato and Clove and Thresh? Don\\'t be stupid,\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI say, helping him back to bed. \"I\\'ll let them fight it \\nout, well see who\\'s in the sky tomorrow night and \\nwork out a plan from there.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re such a bad liar, Katniss. I don\\'t know how \\nyou\\'ve survived this long.\" He begins to mimic me. \"I \\nknew that goat would be a little gold mine. You\\'re a \\nlittle cooler though. Of course, I\\'m not going. He \\nshakes his head. \"Never gamble at cards. You\\'ll lose \\nyour last coin,\" he says. \\n\\nAnger flushes my face. \"All right, I am going, and you \\ncan\\'t stop me!\" \\n\\n\"I can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it \\nto the Cornucopia, but if I\\'m yelling your name, I bet \\nsomeone can find me. And then I\\'ll be dead for sure,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\n\"You won\\'t get a hundred yards from here on that \\nleg,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Then 111 drag myself,\" says Peeta. \"You go and I\\'m \\ngoing, too.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s just stubborn enough and maybe just strong \\nenough to do it. Come howling after me in the woods. \\nEven if a tribute doesn\\'t find him, something else \\nmight. He can\\'t defend himself. I\\'d probably have to \\nwall him up in the cave just to go myself. And who \\nknows what the exertion will do to him? \\n\\n\"What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you \\ndie?\"I say. He must know that\\'s not an option. That \\nthe audience would hate me. And frankly, I would \\nhate myself, too, if I didn\\'t even try. \\n\\n\"I won\\'t die. I promise. If you promise not to go,\" he \\nsays. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re at something of a stalemate. I know I can\\'t \\nargue him out of this one, so I don\\'t try. I pretend, \\nreluctantly, to go along. \"Then you have to do what I \\nsay. Drink your water, wake me when I tell you, and \\neat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it \\nis!\" I snap at him. \\n\\n\"Agreed. Is it ready?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"Wait here,\" I say. The air\\'s gone cold even though the \\nsun\\'s still up. I\\'m right about the Gamemakers \\nmessing with the temperature. I wonder if the thing \\nsomeone needs desperately is a good blanket. The \\nsoup is still nice and warm in its iron pot. And \\nactually doesn\\'t taste too bad. \\n\\nPeeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the \\npot to show his enthusiasm. He rambles on about \\nhow delicious it is, which should be encouraging if \\nyou don\\'t know what fever does to people. He\\'s like \\nlistening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked \\nhim into incoherence. I give him another dose of fever \\nmedicine before he goes off his head completely. \\n\\nAs I go down to the stream to wash up, all I can think \\nis that he\\'s going to die if I don\\'t get to that feast. I\\'ll \\nkeep him going for a day or two, and then the \\ninfection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs \\nand he\\'ll be gone. And 111 be here all alone. Again. \\nWaiting for the others. \\n\\nI\\'m so lost in thought that I almost miss the \\nparachute, even though it floats right by me. Then I \\nspring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off \\nthe silver fabric to retrieve the vial. Haymitch has \\ndone it! He\\'s gotten the medicine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\'t know how, \\npersuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their \\njewels \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I can save Peeta! It\\'s such a tiny vial \\nthough. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nas Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork \\nthe vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the \\nsickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on \\nthe tip of my tongue. There\\'s no question, it\\'s sleep \\nsyrup. It\\'s a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, \\nas medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost \\neveryone\\'s had a dose at one time or another. We \\nhave some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to \\nhysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a \\nbad wound or quiet their minds or just to help \\nsomeone in pain get through the night. It only takes a \\nlittle. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full \\nday, but what good is that? I\\'m so furious I\\'m about \\nto throw Haymitch\\'s last offering into the stream \\nwhen it hits me. A full day? That\\'s more than I need. \\n\\nI mash up a handful of berries so the taste won\\'t be \\nas noticeable and add some mint leaves for good \\nmeasure. Then I head back up to the cave. \"I\\'ve \\nbrought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a \\nlittle farther downstream.\" \\n\\nPeeta opens his mouth for the first bite without \\nhesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. \"They\\'re \\nvery sweet.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, they\\'re sugar berries. My mother makes jam \\nfrom them. Haven\\'t you ever had them before?\" I say, \\npoking the next spoonful in his mouth. \\n\\n\"No,\" he says, almost puzzled. \"But they taste \\nfamiliar. Sugar berries?\" \\n\\n\"Well, you can\\'t get them in the market much, they \\nonly grow wild,\" I say. Another mouthful goes down. \\nJust one more to go. \\n\\n\"They\\'re sweet as syrup,\" he says, taking the last \\nspoonful. \"Syrup.\" His eyes widen as he realizes the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ntruth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose \\nhard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries \\nto make himself vomit the stuff up, but it\\'s too late, \\nhe\\'s already losing consciousness. Even as he fades \\naway, I can see in his eyes what I\\'ve done is \\nunforgivable. \\n\\nI sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture \\nof sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his \\nchin and I wipe it away. \"Who can\\'t lie, Peeta?\" I say, \\neven though he can\\'t hear me. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter. The rest of Panem can. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIn the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks \\nand do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. \\nIt\\'s a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of \\nsweating and shifting things around, I\\'m pretty \\npleased with my work, The cave now appears to be \\npart of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the \\nvicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small \\nopening, but it\\'s undetectable from the out\\xc2\\xab side. \\nThat\\'s good, because I\\'ll need to share that sleeping \\nbag again tonight. Also, if I don\\'t make it back from \\nthe feast, Peeta will be hidden but not entirely \\nimprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much \\nlonger without medicine. If I die at the feast, District \\n12 isn\\'t likely to have a victor. \\n\\nI make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that \\ninhabit the stream down here, fill every water \\ncontainer and purify it, and clean my weapons. I\\'ve \\nnine arrows left in all. I debate leaving the knife with \\nPeeta so hell have some protection while I\\'m gone, \\nbut there\\'s really no point. He was right about \\ncamouflage being his final defense. But I still might \\nhave use for the knife. Who knows what 111 \\nencounter? \\n\\nHere are some things I\\'m fairly certain of. That at \\nleast Cato, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when \\nthe feast starts. I\\'m not sure about Foxface since \\ndirect confrontation isn\\'t her style or her forte. She\\'s \\neven smaller than I am and unarmed, unless she\\'s \\npicked up some weapons recently. Shell probably be \\nhanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can \\nscavenge. But the other three ... I\\'m going to have my \\nhands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my \\ngreatest asset, but I know 111 have to go right into the \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthick of things to get that backpack, the one with the \\nnumber 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith \\nmentioned. \\n\\nI watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at \\ndawn, but nobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there \\nwill be faces up there. Feasts always result in \\nfatalities. \\n\\nI crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up \\nnext to Peeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep \\ntoday. I have to stay awake. I don\\'t really think \\nanyone will attack our cave tonight, but I can\\'t risk \\nmissing the dawn. \\n\\nSo cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the \\nGamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air \\nacross the arena, which may be exactly what they\\'ve \\ndone. I lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb \\nevery bit of his fever heat. It\\'s strange to be so \\nphysically close to someone who\\'s so distant. Peeta \\nmight as well be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, \\nor on the moon right now, he\\'d be no harder to reach. \\nI\\'ve never felt lonelier since the Games began. \\n\\nJust accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not \\nto, but I can\\'t help thinking of my mother and Prim, \\nwondering if they\\'ll sleep a wink tonight. At this late \\nstage in the Games, with an important event like the \\nfeast, school will probably be canceled. My family can \\neither watch on that static-filled old clunker of a \\ntelevision at home or join the crowds in the square to \\nwatch on the big, clear screens, They\\'ll have privacy \\nat home but support in the square. People will give \\nthem a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I \\nwonder if the baker has sought them out, especially \\nnow that Peeta and I are a team, and made good on \\nhis promise to keep my sister\\'s belly full. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSpirits must be running high in District 12. We so \\nrarely have anyone to root for at this point in the \\nGames. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and \\nme, especially now that we\\'re together. If I close my \\neyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging \\nus on. I see their faces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Greasy Sac and Madge and \\neven the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for \\nus. \\n\\nAnd Gale. I know him. He won\\'t be shouting and \\ncheering. But he\\'ll be watching, every moment, every \\ntwist and turn, and willing me to come home. I \\nwonder if he\\'s hoping that Peeta makes it as well. \\nGale\\'s not my boyfriend, but would he be, if I opened \\nthat door? He talked about us running away together. \\nWas that just a practical calculation of our chances of \\nsurvival away from the district? Or something more? \\n\\nI wonder what he makes of all this kissing. \\n\\nThrough a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross \\nthe sky. At what I judge to be about three hours \\nbefore dawn, I begin final preparations. I\\'m careful to \\nleave Peeta with water and the medical kit right \\nbeside him. Nothing else will be of much use if I don\\'t \\nreturn, and even these would only prolong his life a \\nshort time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket \\nand zip it on over my own. He doesn\\'t need it. Not \\nnow in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the \\nday, if I\\'m not there to remove it, hell be roasting in \\nit. My hands are already stiff from cold, so I take \\nRue\\'s spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and \\nthumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill her \\nsmall pack with some food, a water bottle, and \\nbandages, tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and \\narrows. I\\'m about to leave when I remember the \\nimportance of sustaining the star-crossed lover \\nroutine and I lean over and give Peeta a long, \\nlingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of \\nmy own. Then I squeeze through the opening in the \\nrocks out into the night. \\n\\nMy breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. \\nIt\\'s as cold as a November night at home. One where \\nI\\'ve slipped into the woods, lantern in hand, to join \\nGale at some prearranged place where well sit \\nbundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks \\nwrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way \\nas the morning comes on. Oh, Gale, I think. If only \\nyou had my back now . . . \\n\\nI move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite \\nremarkable, but I still sorely miss having the use of \\nmy left ear. I don\\'t know what the explosion did, but it \\ndamaged something deep and irreparable. Never \\nmind. If I get home, 111 be so stinking rich, 111 be able \\nto pay someone to do my hearing. \\n\\nThe woods always look different at night. Even with \\nthe glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. \\nAs if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had \\ngone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions \\nof themselves to take their places. I don\\'t try anything \\ntricky, like taking a new route. I make my way back \\nup the stream and follow the same path back to Rue\\'s \\nhiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see no \\nsign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a \\nquiver of a branch. Either I\\'m the first to arrive or the \\nothers positioned themselves last night. There\\'s still \\nmore than an hour, maybe two, when I wriggle into \\nthe underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to \\nflow. \\n\\nI chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isn\\'t up for \\nmuch more. Thank goodness, I have Peeta\\'s jacket as \\nwell as my own. If not, I\\'d be forced to move around to \\nstay warm. The sky turns a misty morning gray and \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nstill there\\'s no sign of the other tributes. It\\'s not \\nsurprising really. Everyone has distinguished \\nthemselves either by strength or deadliness or \\ncunning. Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta \\nwith me? I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he \\nwas wounded. All the better if they think he\\'s covering \\nme when I go in for the backpack. \\n\\nBut where is it? The arena has lightened enough for \\nme to remove my glasses. I can hear the morning \\nbirds singing. Isn\\'t it time? For a second, I\\'m \\npanicked that I\\'m at the wrong location. But no, I\\'m \\ncertain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying \\nthe Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So \\nwhere\\'s my feast? \\n\\nJust as the first ray of sun glints off the gold \\nCornucopia, there\\'s a disturbance on the plain. The \\nground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and \\na round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the \\narena. On the table sit four backpacks, two large \\nblack ones with the numbers 2and 11, a medium-size \\ngreen one with the number 5, and a tiny orange one \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 really I could carry it around my wrist \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that must \\nbe marked with a. 12. \\n\\nThe table has just clicked into place when a figure \\ndarts out of the Cornucopia, snags the green \\nbackpack, and speeds off. Foxface! Leave it to her to \\ncome up with such a clever and risky idea! The rest of \\nus are still poised around the plain, sizing up the \\nsituation, and she\\'s got hers. She\\'s got us trapped, \\ntoo, because no one wants to chase her down, not \\nwhile their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. \\nFoxface must have purposefully left the other packs \\nalone, knowing that to steal one without her number \\nwould definitely bring on a pursuer. That should have \\nbeen my strategy! By the lime I\\'ve worked through the \\nemotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nfrustration, I\\'m watching that reddish mane of hair \\ndisappear into the trees well out of shooting range. \\nHuh. I\\'m always dreading the others, but maybe \\nFoxface is the real opponent here. \\n\\nShe\\'s cost me time, too, because by now it\\'s clear that \\nI must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to \\nit will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without \\nhesitation, I sprint for the table. I can sense the \\nemergence of danger before I see it. Fortunately, the \\nfirst knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can \\nhear it and I\\'m able to deflect it with my bow. I turn, \\ndrawing back the bowstring and send an arrow \\nstraight at Clove\\'s heart. She turns just enough to \\navoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper \\nleft arm. Unfortunately, she throws with her right, \\nbut it\\'s enough to slow her down a few moments, \\nhaving to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the \\nseverity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning the \\nnext arrow automatically, as only someone who has \\nhunted for years can do. \\n\\nI\\'m at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny \\norange backpack. My hand slips between the straps \\nand I yank it up on my arm, it\\'s really too small to fit \\non any other part of my anatomy, and I\\'m turning to \\nfire again when the second knife catches me in the \\nforehead. It slices above my right eyebrow, opening a \\ngash that sends a gush running down my face, \\nblinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, \\nmetallic taste of my own blood. I stagger backward \\nbut still manage to send my readied arrow in the \\ngeneral direction of my assailant. I know as it leaves \\nmy hands it will miss. And then Clove slams into me, \\nknocking me flat on my back, pinning my shoulders \\nto the ground, with her knees. \\n\\nThis is it, I think, and hope for Prim\\'s sake it will be \\nfast. But Clove means to savor the moment. Even \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nfeels she has time. No doubt Cato is somewhere \\nnearby, guarding her, waiting for Thresh and possibly \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\"Where\\'s your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still \\nhanging on?\" she asks. \\n\\nWell, as long as we\\'re talking I\\'m alive. \"He\\'s out there \\nnow. Hunting Cato,\" I snarl at her. Then I scream at \\nthe top of my lungs. \"Peeta!\" \\n\\nClove jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively \\ncutting off my voice. But her head\\'s whipping from \\nside to side, and I know for a moment she\\'s at least \\nconsidering I\\'m telling the truth. Since no Peeta \\nappears to save me, she turns back to me. \\n\\n\"Liar,\" she says with a grin. \"He\\'s nearly dead. Cato \\nknows where he cut him. You\\'ve probably got him \\nstrapped up in some tree while you try to keep his \\nheart going. What\\'s in the pretty little backpack? That \\nmedicine for Lover Boy? Too bad he\\'ll never get it.\" \\n\\nClove opens her jacket. It\\'s lined with an impressive \\narray of knives. She carefully selects an almost \\ndainty- looking number with a cruel, curved blade. \"I \\npromised Cato if he let me have you, I\\'d give the \\naudience a good show.\" \\n\\nI\\'m struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but it\\'s \\nno use. She\\'s too heavy and her lock on me too tight. \\n\\n\"Forget it, District Twelve. We\\'re going to kill you. \\nJust like we did your pathetic little ally . . . what was \\nher name? The one who hopped around in the trees? \\nRue? Well, first Rue, then you, and then I think we\\'ll \\njust let nature take care of Lover Boy. How does that \\nsound?\" Clove asks. \"Now, where to start?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nShe carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound \\nwith her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my \\nface, tilting it from side to side as if it\\'s a block of \\nwood and she\\'s deciding exactly what pattern to carve \\non it. I attempt to bite her hand, but she grabs the \\nhair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the \\nground. \"I think ...\" she almost purrs. \"I think well \\nstart with your mouth.\" I clamp my teeth together as \\nshe teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip \\nof the blade. \\n\\nI won\\'t close my eyes. The comment about Rue has \\nfilled me with fury, enough fury I think to die with \\nsome dignity. As my last act of defiance, I will stare \\nher down as long as I can see, which will probably not \\nbe an extended period of time, but I will stare her \\ndown, I will not cry out. I will die, in my own small \\nway, undefeated. \\n\\n\"Yes, I don\\'t think youll have much use for your lips \\nanymore. Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss?\" she \\nasks, I work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and \\nspit it in her face. She flushes with rage. \"All right \\nthen. Let\\'s get started.\" \\n\\nI brace myself for the agony that\\'s sure to follow. But \\nas I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great \\nform yanks Clove from my body and then she\\'s \\nscreaming. I\\'m too stunned at first, too unable to \\nprocess what has happened. Has Peeta somehow \\ncome to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers sent in \\nsome wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft \\ninexplicably plucked her into the air? \\n\\nBut when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see \\nit\\'s none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the \\nground, imprisoned in Thresh\\'s arms. I let out a gasp, \\nseeing him like that, towering over me, holding Clove \\nlike a rag doll. I remember him as big, but he seems \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nmore massive, more powerful than I even recall. If \\nanything, he seems to have gained weight in the \\narena. He flips Clove around and flings her onto the \\nground. \\n\\nWhen he shouts, I jump, never having heard him \\nspeak above a mutter. \"What\\'d you do to that little \\ngirl? You kill her?\" \\n\\nClove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a \\nfrantic insect, too shocked to even call for Cato. \"No! \\nNo, it wasn\\'t me!\" \\n\\n\"You said her name. I heard you. You kill her?\" \\nAnother thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his \\nfeatures. \"You cut her up like you were going to cut \\nup this girl here?\" \\n\\n\"No! No, I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" Clove sees the stone, about the size of a \\nsmall loaf of bread in Thresh\\'s hand and loses it. \\n\"Cato!\" she screeches. \"Cato!\" \\n\\n\"Clove!\" I hear Cato\\'s answer, but he\\'s too far away, I \\ncan tell that much, to do her any good. What was he \\ndoing? Trying to get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been \\nlying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his \\nlocation? \\n\\nThresh brings the rock down hard against Clove\\'s \\ntemple. It\\'s not bleeding, but I can see the dent in her \\nskull and I know that she\\'s a goner. There\\'s still life in \\nher now though, in the rapid rise and fall of her \\nchest, the low moan escaping her lips. \\n\\nWhen Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, I \\nknow it\\'s no good to run. And my bow is empty, the \\nlast loaded arrow having gone in Clove\\'s direction. I\\'m \\ntrapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes. \\n\"What\\'d she mean? About Rue being your ally?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. I tried \\nto save her, I did. But he got there first. District One,\" \\nI say. Maybe if he knows I helped Rue, he won\\'t \\nchoose some slow, sadistic end for me. \\n\\n\"And you killed him?\" he demands. \\n\\n\"Yes. I killed him. And buried her in flowers,\" I \\nsay. \"And I sang her to sleep.\" \\n\\nTears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes \\nout of me at the memory. And I\\'m overwhelmed by \\nRue, and the pain in my head, and my fear of Thresh, \\nand the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away. \\n\\n\"To sleep?\" Thresh says gruffly. \\n\\n\"To death. I sang until she died,\" I say. \"Your \\ndistrict... they sent me bread.\" My hand reaches up \\nbut not for an arrow that I know 111 never reach. Just \\nto wipe my nose. \"Do it fast, okay, Thresh?\" \\n\\nConflicting emotions cross Thresh\\'s face. He lowers \\nthe rock and points at me, almost accusingly. \"Just \\nthis one time, I let you go. For the little girl. You and \\nme, we\\'re even then. No more owed. You \\nunderstand?\" \\n\\nI nod because I do understand. About owing. About \\nhating it. I understand that if Thresh wins, he\\'ll have \\nto go back and face a district that has already broken \\nall the rules to thank me, and he is breaking the rules \\nto thank me, too. And I understand that, for the \\nmoment, Thresh is not going to smash in my skull. \\n\\n\"Clove!\" Cato\\'s voice is much nearer now. I can tell by \\nthe pain in it that he sees her on the ground. \\n\\n\"You better run now, Fire Girl,\" says Thresh. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dip \\ninto the hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh \\nand Clove and the sound of Cato\\'s voice. Only when I \\nreach the woods do I turn back for an instant. Thresh \\nand both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge \\nof the plain into the area I\\'ve never seen. Cato kneels \\nbeside Clove, spear in hand, begging her to stay with \\nhim. In a moment, he will realize it\\'s futile, she can\\'t \\nbe saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping \\naway the blood that\\'s pouring into my eye, fleeing like \\nthe wild, wounded creature I am. After a few minutes, \\nI hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died, \\nthat Cato will be on one of our trails. Either Thresh\\'s \\nor mine. I\\'m seized with terror, weak from my head \\nwound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can throw \\nthat spear almost as far as I can shoot. \\n\\nOnly one thing calms me down. Thresh has Cato\\'s \\nbackpack containing the thing he needs desperately. \\nIf I had to bet, Cato headed out after Thresh, not me. \\nStill I don\\'t slow down when I reach the water. I \\nplunge right in, boots still on, and flounder \\ndownstream. I pull off Rue\\'s socks that I\\'ve been \\nusing for gloves and press them into my forehead, \\ntrying to staunch the flow of blood, but they\\'re soaked \\nin minutes. \\n\\nSomehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze \\nthrough the rocks. In the dappled light, I pull the \\nlittle orange backpack from my arm, cut open the \\nclasp, and dump the contents on the ground. One \\nslim box containing one hypodermic needle. Without \\nhesitating, I jam the needle into Peeta\\'s arm and \\nslowly press down on the plunger. \\n\\nMy hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, \\nslick with blood. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful \\ngreen- and- silver moth landing on the curve of my \\nwrist. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house \\ngently pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to \\nreturn to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of \\nblankets, safe at home. I\\'m vaguely aware that my \\nhead aches. Possibly I have the flu and this is why I\\'m \\nallowed to stay in bed, even though I can tell I\\'ve been \\nasleep a long time. My mother\\'s hand strokes my \\ncheek and I don\\'t push it away as I would in \\nwakefulness, never wanting her to know how much I \\ncrave that gentle touch. How much I miss her even \\nthough I still don\\'t trust her. Then there\\'s a voice, the \\nwrong voice, not my mother\\'s, and I\\'m scared. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" it says. \"Katniss, can you hear me?\" \\n\\nMy eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I\\'m \\nnot home, not with my mother. I\\'m in a dim, chilly \\ncave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air \\ntainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The \\nhaggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after \\nan initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. \"Peeta.\" \\n\\n\"Hey,\" he says. \"Good to see your eyes again.\" \\n\\n\"How long have I been out?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were \\nlying next to me in a very scary pool of blood,\" he \\nsays. \"I think it\\'s stopped finally, but I wouldn\\'t sit up \\nor anything.\" \\n\\nI gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it \\nbandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and \\ndizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink \\nthirstily. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re better,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the \\ntrick,\" he says. \"By this morning, almost all the \\nswelling in my leg was gone.\" \\n\\nHe doesn\\'t seem angry about my tricking him, \\ndrugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I\\'m \\njust too beat-up and 111 hear about it later when I\\'m \\nstronger. But for the moment, he\\'s all gentleness. \\n\\n\"Did you eat?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that \\ngroosling before I realized it might have to last a \\nwhile. Don\\'t worry, I\\'m back on a strict diet,\" he says. \\n\\n\"No, it\\'s good. You need to eat. I\\'ll go hunting soon, \"I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"Not too soon, all right?\" he says. \"You just let me \\ntake care of you for a while.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds \\nme bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink \\nplenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my \\nfeet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the \\nsleeping bag back up around my chin. \\n\\n\"Your boots and socks are still damp and the \\nweather\\'s not helping much,\" he says. There\\'s a clap \\nof thunder, and I see lightning electrify the sky \\nthrough an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through \\nseveral holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort \\nof canopy over my head an upper body by wedging \\nthe square of plastic into the rock above me. \\n\\n\"I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who\\'s \\nthe target?\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cato and Thresh,\" I say without thinking. \"Foxface \\nwill be in her den somewhere, and Clove ... she cut \\nme an then ...\"My voice trails off. \\n\\n\"I know Clove\\'s dead. I saw it in the sky last night,\" he \\nsays. \"Did you kill her?\" \\n\\n\"No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Lucky he didn\\'t catch you, too,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nThe memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel \\nsick. \"He did. But he let me go.\" Then, of course, I \\nhave to tell him. About things I\\'ve kept to myself \\nbecause he was too sick to ask and I wasn\\'t ready to \\nrelive anyway. Like the explosion and my ear and \\nRue\\'s dying and the boy from District 1 and the \\nbread. All of which leads to what happened with \\nThresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts. \\n\\n\"He let you go because he didn\\'t want to owe you \\nanything?\" asks Peeta in disbelief. \\n\\n\"Yes. I don\\'t expect you to understand it. You\\'ve \\nalways had enough. But if you\\'d lived in the Seam, I \\nwouldn\\'t have to explain,\" I say. \\n\\n\"And don\\'t try. Obviously I\\'m too dim to get it.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s like the bread. How I never seem to get over \\nowing you for that,\" I say. \\n\\n\"The bread? What? From when we were kids?\" he \\nsays. \"I think we can let that go. I mean, you just \\nbrought me back from the dead.\" \\n\\n\"But you didn\\'t know me. We had never even spoken. \\nBesides, it\\'s the first gift that\\'s always the hardest to \\npay back. I wouldn\\'t even have been here to do it if \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nyou hadn\\'t helped me then,\" I say. \"Why did you, \\nanyway?\" \\n\\n\"Why? You know why,\" Peeta says. I give my head a \\nslight, painful shake. \"Haymitch said you would take \\na lot of convincing.\" \\n\\n\"Haymitch?\" I ask. \"What\\'s he got to do with it?\" \\n\\n\"Nothing,\" Peeta says. \"So, Cato and Thresh, huh? I \\nguess it\\'s too much to hope that they\\'ll \\nsimultaneously destroy each other?\" \\n\\nBut the thought only upsets me. \"I think we would \\nlike Thresh. I think he\\'d be our friend back in District \\nTwelve,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Then let\\'s hope Cato kills him, so we don\\'t have \\nto, \"says Peeta grimly. \\n\\nI don\\'t want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I don\\'t want \\nanyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind \\nof thing that victors go around saying in the arena. \\nDespite my best efforts, I can feel tears starting to \\npool in my eyes. \\n\\nPeeta looks at me in concern. \"What is it? Are you in \\na lot of pain?\" \\n\\nI give him another answer, because it is equally true \\nbut can be taken as a brief moment of weakness \\ninstead of a terminal one. \"I want to go home, Peeta,\" \\nI say plaintively, like a small child. \\n\\n\"You will. I promise,\" he says, and bends over to give \\nme a kiss. \\n\\n\"I want to go home now,\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of \\nhome. And you 11 be there for real before you know \\nit/\\'lie says. \"Okay?\" \\n\\n\"Okay,\" I whisper. \"Wake me if you need me to keep \\nwatch.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. \\nBesides, who knows how long this will last?\" he says. \\n\\nWhat does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii \\nbrings us? The Games themselves? I don\\'t know, but \\nI\\'m ion sad and tired to ask. \\n\\nIt\\'s evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has \\nturned to a downpour, sending streams of water \\nthrough our ceiling where earlier there had been only \\ndrips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst \\none and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it \\nfrom me. I feel a bit better, able to sit up without \\ngetting too dizzy, and I\\'m absolutely famished. So is \\nPeeta. It\\'s clear he\\'s been waiting for me to wake up to \\neat and is eager to get started. \\n\\nThere\\'s not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small \\nmishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit. \\n\\n\"Should we try and ration it?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"No, let\\'s just finish it. The groosling\\'s getting old \\nanyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick \\noffspoilt food,\" I say, dividing the food into two equal \\npiles. We tryand eat slowly, but we\\'re both so hungry \\nwere done in a couple of minutes. My stomach is in \\nno way satisfied. \"Tomorrow\\'s a hunting day,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I won\\'t be much help with that,\" Peeta says. \"I\\'ve \\nnever hunted before.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll kill and you cook,\" I say. \"And you can always \\ngather.\" \\n\\n\"I wish there was some sort of bread bush out \\nthere, \"says Peeta. \\n\\n\"The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still \\nwarm,\" I say with a sigh. \"Here, chew these.\" I hand \\nhim a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own \\nmouth. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it\\'s \\nclear enough to know there were no more deaths \\ntoday. So Cato and Thresh haven\\'t had it out yet. \\n\\n\"Where did Thresh go? I mean, what\\'s on the far side \\nof the circle?\" I ask Peeta. \\n\\n\"A field. As far as you can see it\\'s full of grasses as \\nhigh as my shoulders. I don\\'t know, maybe some of \\nthem are grain. There are patches of different colors. \\nBut there are no paths, \"says Peeta. \\n\\n\"I bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows \\nwhich ones, too,\" I say. \"Did you go in there?\" \\n\\n\"No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in \\nthat grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I \\nlook at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. \\nSnakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand,\" Peeta \\nsays. \"There could be anything in there.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t say so but Peeta\\'s words remind me of the \\nwarnings they give us about not going beyond the \\nfence in District 12.1 can\\'t help, for a moment, \\ncomparing him with Gale, who would see that field as \\na potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh \\ncertainly did. It\\'s not that Peeta\\'s soft exactly, and \\nhe\\'s proved he\\'s not a coward. But there are things \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nyou don\\'t question too much, I guess, when your \\nhome always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale \\nquestions everything. What would Peeta think of the \\nirreverent banter that passes between us as we break \\nthe law each day? Would it shock him? The things we \\nsay about Panem? Gale\\'s tirades against the Capitol? \\n\\n\"Maybe there is a bread bush in that field,\" I \\n\\nsay. \"Maybe that\\'s why Thresh looks better fed now \\n\\nthan when we started the Games.\" \\n\\n\"Either that or he\\'s got very generous sponsors,\" says \\nPeeta. \"I wonder what we\\'d have to do to get Haymitch \\nto send us some bread.\" \\n\\nI raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn\\'t \\nknow about the message Haymitch sent us a couple \\nof nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. It\\'s \\nnot the sort of thing I can blurt out, either. To say my \\nthoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that \\nthe romance has been fabricated to play on their \\nsympathies and that would result in no food at all. \\nSomehow, believably, I\\'ve got to get things back on \\ntrack. Something simple to start with. I reach out and \\ntake his hand. \\n\\n\"Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping \\nme knock you out,\" I say mischievously. \\n\\n\"Yeah, about that,\" says Peeta, entwining his fingers \\nin mine. \"Don\\'t try something like that again.\" \\n\\n\"Or what?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Or ... or ...\" He can\\'t think of anything good. \"Just \\ngive me a minute.\" \\n\\n\"What\\'s the problem?\" I say with a grin. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"The problem is we\\'re both still alive. Which only \\nreinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right \\nthing,\"says Peeta. \\n\\n\"I did do the right thing,\" I say. \\n\\n\"No! Just don\\'t, Katniss!\" His grip tightens, hurting \\nmy hand, and there\\'s real anger in his voice. \"Don\\'t \\ndie for me. You won\\'t be doing me any favors. All \\nright?\" \\n\\nI\\'m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent \\nopportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. \\n\"Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of \\nthat? Maybe you aren\\'t the only one who . . . who \\nworries about ... what it would be like if...\" \\n\\nI fumble. I\\'m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And \\nwhile I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta \\nhit me again and I realized how much I don\\'t want \\nhim to die. And it\\'s not about the sponsors. And it\\'s \\nnot about what will happen back home. And it\\'s not \\njust that I don\\'t want to be alone. It\\'s him. I do not \\nwant to lose the boy with the bread. \\n\\n\"If what, Katniss?\" he says softly. \\n\\nI wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out \\nthis moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it \\nmeans losing food. Whatever I\\'m feeling, it\\'s no one\\'s \\nbusiness but mine. \\n\\n\"That\\'s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to \\nsteer clear of,\" I say evasively, although Haymitch \\nnever said anything of the kind. In fact, he\\'s probably \\ncursing me out right now for dropping the ball during \\nsuch an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta \\nsomehow catches it. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then 111 just have to fill in the blanks myself,\" he \\nsays, and moves in to me. \\n\\nThis is the first kiss that we\\'re both fully aware of. \\nNeither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply \\nunconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or \\nicy cold. This is the first kiss where I actually feel \\nstirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is \\nthe first kiss that makes me want another. \\n\\nBut I don\\'t get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it\\'s \\njust a light one on the tip of my nose because Peeta\\'s \\nbeen distracted. \"I think your wound is bleeding \\nagain. Come on, lie down, it\\'s bedtime anyway,\" he \\nsays. \\n\\nMy socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta \\nput his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut \\nright down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. I \\ninsist on taking the first watch, too, although neither \\nof us think it\\'s likely anyone will come in this \\nweather. But he won\\'t agree unless I\\'m in the bag, \\ntoo, and I\\'m shivering so hard that it\\'s pointless to \\nobject. In stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt \\nPeeta was a million miles away, I\\'m struck by his \\nimmediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head \\ndown to use his arm as a pillow, the other rests \\nprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No \\none has held me like this in such a long time. Since \\nmy father died and I stopped trusting my mother, no \\none else\\'s arms have made me feel this safe. \\n\\nWith the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of \\nwater splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. \\nSeveral times, I drift off briefly and then snap awake, \\nguilty and angry with myself. After three or four \\nhours, I can\\'t help it, I have to rouse Peeta because I \\ncan\\'t keep my eyes open. He doesn\\'t seem to mind. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tomorrow, when it\\'s dry, 111 find us a place so high \\nin the trees we can both sleep in peace,\" I promise as \\nI drift off. \\n\\nBut tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The \\ndeluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on \\nwashing us all away. The thunder\\'s so powerful it \\nseems to shake the ground. Peeta\\'s considering \\nheading out anyway to scavenge for food, but I tell \\nhim in this storm it would be pointless. He won\\'t be \\nable to see three feet in front of his face and hell only \\nend up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He \\nknows I\\'m right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is \\nbecoming painful. \\n\\nThe day drags on turning into evening and there\\'s no \\nbreak in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but \\nnothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\neverything will cost an exorbitant amount \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or \\nbecause he\\'s dissatisfied with our performance. \\nProbably the latter. I\\'d be the first to admit we\\'re not \\nexactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, \\ntrying not to reopen wounds. We\\'re sitting huddled \\ntogether wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly \\nto keep warm. The most exciting thing either of us \\ndoes is nap. \\n\\nI\\'m not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The \\nkiss last night was nice, but working up to another \\nwill take some forethought. There are girls in the \\nSeam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate \\nthese waters so easily. But I\\'ve never had much time \\nor use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn\\'t enough \\nanymore clearly because if it was we\\'d have gotten \\nfood last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn\\'t \\njust looking for physical affection, he wants \\nsomething more personal. The sort of stuff he was \\ntrying to get me to tell about myself when we were \\npracticing for the interview. I\\'m rotten at it, but \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta\\'s not. Maybe the best approach is to get him \\ntalking. \\n\\n\"Peeta,\" I say lightly. \"You said at the interview you\\'d \\nhad a crush on me forever. When did forever start?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, let\\'s see. I guess the first day of school. We were \\nfive. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair ... it \\nwas in two braids instead of one. My father pointed \\nyou out when we were waiting to line up,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Your father? Why?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"He said, \\'See that little girl? I wanted to marry her \\nmother, but she ran off with a coal miner,\\'\" Peeta \\nsays. \\n\\n\"What? You\\'re making that up!\" I exclaim. \\n\\n\"No, true story,\" Peeta says. \"And I said, \\'A coal \\nminer? Why did she want a coal miner if she could Ve \\nhad you?\\' And he said, \\'Because when he sings ... \\neven the birds stop to listen.\\'\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s true. They do. I mean, they did,\" I say. I\\'m \\nstunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the \\nbaker telling this to Peeta. It strikes me that my own \\nreluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might \\nnot really be that I think it\\'s a waste of time. It might \\nbe because it reminds me too much of my father. \\n\\n\"So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked \\nwho knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in \\nthe air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing \\nit for us. And I swear, every bird outside the windows \\nfell silent,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Oh, please,\" I say, laughing. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I \\nknew \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just like your mother \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I was a goner,\" Peeta \\nsays. \"Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work \\nup the nerve to talk to you.\" \\n\\n\"Without success,\" I add. \\n\\n\"Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn \\nin the reaping was a real piece of luck,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nFor a moment, I\\'m almost foolishly happy and then \\nconfusion sweeps over me. Because we\\'re supposed to \\nbe making up this stuff, playing at being in love not \\nactually being in love. But Peeta\\'s story has a ring of \\ntruth to it. That part about my father and the birds. \\nAnd I did sing the first day of school, although I don\\'t \\nremember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . there \\nwas one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to \\nrags after my father\\'s death. \\n\\nIt would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a \\nbeating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. \\nSo, if those details are true ... could it all be true? \\n\\n\"You have a ... remarkable memory,\" I say haltingly. \\n\\n\"I remember everything about you,\" says Peeta, \\ntucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. \"You\\'re \\nthe one who wasn\\'t paying attention.\" \\n\\n\"I am now,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t have much competition here,\" he says. \\n\\nI want to draw away, to close those shutters again, \\nbut I know I can\\'t. It\\'s as if I can hear Haymitch \\nwhispering in my ear, \"Say it! Say it!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI swallow hard and get the words out. \"You don\\'t have \\nmuch competition anywhere.\" And this time, it\\'s me \\nwho leans in. \\n\\nOur lips have just barely touched when the clunk \\noutside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow \\nready to fly, but there\\'s no other sound. Peeta peers \\nthrough the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before I \\ncan stop him, lie\\'s out in the rain, then handing \\nsomething in to me. A silver parachute attached to a \\nbasket. I rip it open at once and inside there\\'s a feast \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a \\ntureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The \\nvery dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most \\nimpressive thing the Capitol had to offer. \\n\\nPeeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. \\n\"I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us \\nstarve.\" \\n\\n\"I guess so,\" I answer. \\n\\nBut in my head I can hear Haymitch \\'s smug, if \\nslightly exasperated, words, \"Yes, that\\'s what I\\'m \\nlooking lot, sweetheart.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nEvery cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew \\nand cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But \\nPeeta\\'s voice stops me. \"We better take it slow on that \\nstew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich \\nfood made me sick and I wasn\\'t even starving then.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re right. And I could just inhale the whole \\nthing!\"I say regretfully. But I don\\'t. We are quite \\nsensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an \\negg- size serving of stew and rice. I make myself eat \\nthe stew in tiny spoonfuls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they even sent us \\nsilverware and plates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 savoring each bite. When we \\nfinish, I stare longingly at the dish. \"I want more.\" \\n\\n\"Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays \\ndown, then we get another serving,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Agreed,\" I say. \"It\\'s going to be a long hour.\" \\n\\n\"Maybe not that long,\" says Peeta. \"What was that \\nyou were saying just before the food arrived? \\nSomething about me ... no competition ... best thing \\nthat ever happened to you ...\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember that last part,\" I say, hoping it\\'s too \\ndim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush. \\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s right. That\\'s what / was thinking,\" he says. \\n\"Scoot over, I\\'m freezing.\" \\n\\nI make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean \\nback against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, \\nhis arms wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch \\nnudging me to keep up the act. \"So, since we were \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nfive, you never even noticed any other girls?\" I ask \\nhim. \\n\\n\"No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them \\nmade a lasting impression but you,\" he says. \\n\\n\"I\\'m sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a \\ngirl from the Seam,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Hardly. But I couldn\\'t care less. Anyway, if we make \\nit back, you won\\'t be a girl from the Seam, you\\'ll be a \\ngirl from the Victor\\'s Village,\" he says. \\n\\nThat\\'s right. If we win, well each get a house in the \\npart of town reserved for Hunger Games\\' victors. Long \\nago, when the Games began, the Capitol had built a \\ndozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours \\nonly one is occupied. Most of the others have never \\nbeen lived in at all. \\n\\nA disturbing thought hits me. \"But then, our only \\nneighbor will be Haymitch!\" \\n\\n\"Ah, thatll be nice,\" says Peeta, tightening his arms \\naround me. \"You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. \\nPicnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire \\nretelling old Hunger Games \\'tales.\" \\n\\n\"I told you, he hates me!\" I say, but I can\\'t help \\nlaughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new \\npal. \\n\\n\"Only sometimes. When he\\'s sober, I\\'ve never heard \\nhim say one negative thing about you,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He\\'s never sober!\" I protest. \\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It\\'s \\nCinna who likes you. But that\\'s mainly because you \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t try to run when he set you on fire,\" says Peeta. \\n\"On the other hand, Haymitch . . . well, if I were you, \\nI\\'d avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you.\" \\n\\n\"I thought you said I was his favorite,\" I say. \\n\\n\"He hates me more,\" says Peeta. \"I don\\'t think people \\nin general are his sort of thing.\" \\n\\nI know the audience will enjoy our having fun at \\nHaymitch\\'s expense. He has been around so long, \\nhe\\'s practically an old friend to some of them. And \\nafter his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, \\neverybody knows him. By this time, they\\'ll have \\ndragged him out of the control room for interviews \\nabout us. No telling what sort of lies he\\'s made up. \\nHe\\'s at something of a disadvantage because most \\nmentors have a partner, another victor to help them \\nwhereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at \\nany moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the \\narena. I wonder how he\\'s holding up, with the \\ndrinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to \\nkeep us alive. \\n\\nIt\\'s funny. Haymitch and I don\\'t get along well in \\nperson, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike \\nbecause he seems able to communicate with me by \\nthe timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be \\nclose to water when he withheld it and how I knew \\nthe sleep syrup just wasn\\'t something to ease Peeta\\'s \\npain and how I know now that I have to play up the \\nromance. He hasn\\'t made much effort to connect with \\nPeeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would \\njust be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I\\'ll see the \\nstrings attached to it. \\n\\nA thought hits me, and I\\'m amazed the question\\'s \\ntaken so long to surface. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'ve only \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nrecently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of \\ncuriosity. \"How do you think he did it?\" \\n\\n\"Who? Did what?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?\" I \\nsay. \\n\\nPeeta considers this quite a while before he answers. \\nHaymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder \\nlike Cato or Thresh. He\\'s not particularly handsome. \\nNot in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on \\nyou. And he\\'s so surly, it\\'s hard to imagine anyone \\nteaming up with him. There\\'s only one way Haymitch \\ncould have won, and Peeta says it just as I\\'m reaching \\nthis conclusion myself. \\n\\n\"He outsmarted the others,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I\\'m \\nwondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to \\nhelp Peeta and me because he thought we just might \\nhave the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn\\'t always a \\ndrunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the \\ntributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to \\nmentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after \\nyear after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that \\nwill become my job. To mentor the girl from District \\n12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind. \\n\\nAbout half an hour has passed before I decide I have \\nto eat again. Peeta\\'s too hungry himself to put up an \\nargument. While I\\'m dishing up two more small \\nservings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem \\nbegin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack \\nin the rocks to watch the sky. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"There won\\'t be anything to see tonight,\" I say, far \\nmore interested in the stew than the sky. \"Nothing\\'s \\nhappened or we would\\'ve heard a cannon.\" \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" Peeta says quietly. \\n\\n\"What? Should we split another roll, too?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he repeats, but I find myself wanting to \\nignore him. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to split one. But 111 save the cheese for \\ntomorrow,\" I say. I see Peeta staring at me. \"What?\" \\n\\n\"Thresh is dead,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He can\\'t be,\" I say. \\n\\n\"They must have fired the cannon during the thunder \\nand we missed it,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Are you sure? I mean, it\\'s pouring buckets out there. \\nI don\\'t know how you can see anything,\" I say. I push \\nhim away from the rocks and squint out into the \\ndark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a \\ndistorted glimpse of Thresh\\'s picture and then he\\'s \\ngone. Just like that. \\n\\nI slump down against the rocks, momentarily \\nforgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I \\nshould be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And \\na powerful one, too. But I\\'m not happy. All I can think \\nabout is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because \\nof Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach... . \\n\\n\"You all right?\" asks Peeta. \\n\\nI give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my \\nhands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthe real pain because who\\'s going to bet on a tribute \\nwho keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. \\nRue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. \\nBut no one will understand my sorrow at Thresh\\'s \\nmurder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! \\nThankfully, I didn\\'t say it aloud. That\\'s not going to \\nwin me any points in the arena. What I do say is, \"It\\'s \\njust ... if we didn\\'t win ... I wanted Thresh to. Because \\nhe let me go. And because of Rue.\" \\n\\n\"Yeah, I know,\" says Peeta. \"But this means we\\'re one \\nstep closer to District Twelve.\" He nudges a plate of \\nfoot into my hands. \"Eat. It\\'s still warm.\" \\n\\nI take a bite of the stew to show I don\\'t really care, \\nbut it\\'s like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort \\nto swallow. \"It also means Cato will be back hunting \\nus.\" \\n\\n\"And he\\'s got supplies again,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"Hell be wounded, I bet,\" I say. \\n\\n\"What makes you say that?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"Because Thresh would have never gone down \\nwithout a fight. He\\'s so strong, I mean, he was. And \\nthey were in his territory,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Good,\" says Peeta. \"The more wounded Cato is the \\nbetter. I wonder how Foxface is making out.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, she\\'s fine,\" I say peevishly. I\\'m still angry she \\nthought of hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn\\'t. \\n\"Probably be easier to catch Cato than her.\" \\n\\n\"Maybe theyH catch each other and we can just go \\nhome,\" says Peeta. \"But we better be extra careful \\nabout the watches. I dozed off a few times.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Me, too,\" I admit. \"But not tonight.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nWe finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to \\ntake the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping \\nbag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to \\nhide it from the cameras. I just need a few moments \\nof privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face \\nwithout being seen. Under the hood, I silently say \\ngood-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I \\npromise to remember him and, if I can, do something \\nto help his family and Rue\\'s, if I win. Then I escape \\ninto sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady \\nwarmth of Peeta beside me. \\n\\nWhen Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is \\nthe smell of goat cheese. He\\'s holding out half a roll \\nspread with the creamy white stuff and topped with \\napple slices. \"Don\\'t be mad,\" he says. \"I had to eat \\nagain. Here\\'s your half.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, good,\" I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The \\nstrong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim \\nmakes, the apples are sweet and crunchy. \"Mm.\" \\n\\n\"We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery,\" \\nhe says. \\n\\n\"Bet that\\'s expensive,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless it\\'s gone \\nvery stale. Of course, practically everything we eat is \\nstale, \"says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around \\nhim. In less than a minute, he\\'s snoring. \\n\\nHuh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft \\nlife. \\n\\nAnd it\\'s true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. \\nBut there\\'s something kind of depressing about living \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nyour life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no \\none else wanted. One thing about us, since I bring \\nour food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh \\nyou have to make sure it isn\\'t going to make a run for \\nit. \\n\\nSomewhere during my shift, the rain stops not \\ngradually but all at once. The downpour ends and \\nthere\\'s only the residual drippings of water from \\nbranches, the rush of the now overflowing stream \\nbelow us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even \\nwithout the glasses I can see outside. I can\\'t decide if \\nthe moon is real or merely a projection of the \\nGamemakers. I know it was full shortly before I left \\nhome. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into \\nthe late hours. \\n\\nHow long have I been gone? I\\'m guessing it\\'s been \\nabout two weeks in the arena, and there was that \\nweek of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon \\nhas completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly \\nwant it to be my moon, the same one I see from the \\nwoods around District 12. That would give me \\nsomething to cling to in the surreal world of the arena \\nwhere the authenticity of everything is to be doubted. \\n\\nFour of us left. \\n\\nFor the first time, I allow myself to truly think about \\nthe possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To \\nwealth. To my own house in the Victor\\'s Village. My \\nmother and Prim would live there with me. No more \\nfear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then ... \\nwhat? What would my life be like on a daily basis? \\nMost of it has been consumed with the acquisition of \\nfood. Take that away and I\\'m not really sure who I \\nam, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. I \\nthink of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his \\nlife become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nof his waking hours drunk. I don\\'t want to end up like \\nthat. \\n\\n\"But you won\\'t be alone,\" I whisper to myself. I have \\nmy mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And \\nthen ... I don\\'t want to think about then, when Prim \\nhas grown up, my mother passed away. I know 111 \\nnever marry, never risk bringing a child into the \\nworld. Because if there\\'s one thing being a victor \\ndoesn\\'t guarantee, it\\'s your children\\'s safety. My kids\\' \\nnames would go right into the reaping balls with \\neveryone else\\'s. And I swear I\\'ll never let that happen. \\n\\nThe sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the \\ncracks and illuminating Peeta\\'s face. Who will he \\ntransform into if we make it home? This perplexing, \\ngood-natured boy who can spin out lies so \\nconvincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be \\nhopelessly in love with me, and 111 admit it, there are \\nmoments when he makes me believe it myself? At \\nleast, we\\'ll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the \\nfact that we\\'ve saved each other\\'s lives in here. And \\nbeyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. \\nGood friends. Any thing beyond that though ... and I \\nfeel Gale\\'s gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all \\nthe way from District 12. \\n\\nDiscomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake \\nPeeta\\'s shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when \\nthey focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss. \\n\\n\"We\\'re wasting hunting time,\" I say when I finally \\nbreak away. \\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t call it wasting,\" he says giving a big \\nstretch as he sits up. \"So do we hunt on empty \\nstomachs to give us an edge?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not us,\" I say. \"We stuff ourselves to give us staying \\npower.\" \\n\\n\"Count me in,\" Peeta says. But I can see he\\'s \\nsurprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice \\nand hand a heaping plate to him. \"All this?\" \\n\\n\"Well earn it back today,\" I say, and we both plow \\ninto our plates. Even cold, it\\'s one of the best things \\nI\\'ve ever tasted. I abandon my fork and scrape up the \\nlast dabs of gravy with my finger. \"I can feel Effie \\nTrinket shuddering at my manners.\" \\n\\n\"Hey, Effie, watch this!\" says Peeta. He tosses his fork \\nover his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean \\nwith his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then \\nhe blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, \"We \\nmiss you, Effie!\" \\n\\nI cover his mouth with my hand, but I\\'m laughing. \\n\"Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave.\" \\n\\nHe grabs my hand away. \"What do I care? I\\'ve got you \\nto protect me now,\" says Peeta, pulling me to him. \\n\\n\"Come on,\" I say in exasperation, extricating myself \\nfrom his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. \\n\\nOnce we\\'re packed up and standing outside our cave, \\nour mood shifts to serious. It\\'s as though for the last \\nfew days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and \\nCato\\'s preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a \\nrespite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is \\nsunny and warm, we both sense we\\'re really back in \\nthe Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever \\nweapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it \\ninto his belt. My last seven arrows \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of the twelve I \\nsacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nrattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I can\\'t afford to \\nlose any more. \\n\\n\"He\\'ll be hunting us by now,\" says Peeta. \"Cato isn\\'t \\none to wait for his prey to wander by.\" \\n\\n\"If he\\'s wounded \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" I begin. \\n\\n\"It won\\'t matter,\" Peeta breaks in. \"If he can move, \\nhe\\'s coming.\" \\n\\nWith all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by \\nseveral feet on either side. We stop there to replenish \\nour water. I check the snares I set days ago and come \\nup empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, I \\nhaven\\'t seen many animals or signs of them in this \\narea. \\n\\n\"If we want food, we better head back up to my old \\nhunting grounds,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do,\" \\nPeeta says. \\n\\n\"Keep an eye out,\" I say. \"Stay on the rocks as much \\nas possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. \\nAnd listen for both of us.\" It\\'s clear, at this point, that \\nthe explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for \\ngood. \\n\\nI\\'d walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, \\nbut I\\'m not sure Peeta\\'s leg could take the current. \\nAlthough the drugs have erased the infection, he\\'s \\nstill pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife \\ncut, but after three days the bleeding has stopped. I \\nwear a bandage around my head though, just in case \\nphysical exertion should bring it back. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAs we head up alongside the stream, we pass the \\nplace where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds \\nand mud. One good thing, between the downpour and \\nthe flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have \\nbeen wiped out. That means that, if need be, we can \\ncome back to our cave. Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t risk it \\nwith Cato after us. \\n\\nThe boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn \\nto pebbles, and then, to my relief, we\\'re back on pine \\nneedles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For \\nthe first time, I realize we have a problem. Navigating \\nthe rocky terrain with a bad leg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well, you\\'re \\nnaturally going to make some noise. But even on the \\nsmooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I \\nmeanloudloud, as if he\\'s stomping his feet or \\nsomething. I turn and look at him. \\n\\n\"What?\" he asks. \\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to move more quietly,\" I say. \"Forget about \\nCato, you\\'re chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile \\nradius.\" \\n\\n\"Really?\" he says. \"Sorry, I didn\\'t know.\" \\n\\nSo, we start up again and he\\'s a tiny bit better, but \\neven with only one working ear, he\\'s making me \\njump. \\n\\n\"Can you take your boots off?\" I suggest. \\n\\n\"Here?\" he asks in disbelief, as if I\\'d asked him to \\nwalk barefoot on hot coals or something. I have to \\nremind myself that he\\'s still not used to the woods, \\nthat it\\'s the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences \\nof District 12. I think of Gale, with his velvet tread. \\nIt\\'s eerie how little sound he makes, even when the \\nleaves have fallen and it\\'s a challenge to move at all \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nwithout chasing off the game. I feel certain he\\'s \\nlaughing back home. \\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say patiently. \"I will, too. That way well both \\nbe quieter.\" Like I was making any noise. So we both \\nstrip off our boots and socks and, while there\\'s some \\nimprovement, I could swear he\\'s making an effort to \\nsnap every branch we encounter. \\n\\nNeedless to say, although it takes several hours to \\nreach my old camp with Rue, I\\'ve shot nothing. If the \\nstream would settle down, fish might be an option, \\nbut the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest \\nand drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, \\nI\\'d dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering \\nchore and go hunt, but then he\\'d be left with only a \\nknife to defend himself against Cato\\'s spears and \\nsuperior strength. So what I\\'d really like is to try and \\nconceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come \\nback and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn\\'t \\ngoing to go for that suggestion. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he says. \"We need to split up. I know I\\'m \\nchasing away the game.\" \\n\\n\"Only because your leg\\'s hurt,\" I say generously, \\nbecause really, you can tell that\\'s only a small part of \\nthe problem. \\n\\n\"I know,\" he says. \"So, why don\\'t you go on? Show me \\nsome plants to gather and that way well both be \\nuseful.\" \\n\\n\"Not if Cato comes and kills you.\" I tried to say it in a \\nnice way, but it still sounds like I think he\\'s a \\nweakling. \\n\\nSurprisingly, he just laughs. \"Look, I can handle \\nCato. I fought him before, didn\\'t I?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying \\nin a mud bank. That\\'s what I want to say, but I can\\'t. \\nHe did save my life by taking on Cato after all. I try \\nanother tactic. \"What if you climbed up in a tree and \\nacted as a lookout while I hunted?\" I say, trying to \\nmake it sound like very important work. \\n\\n\"What if you show me what\\'s edible around here and \\ngo get us some meat?\" he says, mimicking my tone. \\n\"Just don\\'t go far, in case you need help.\" \\n\\nI sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need \\nfood, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of \\ncheese the size of a plum won\\'t last long. Ill just go a \\nshort distance and hope Cato is a long way off. \\n\\nI teach him a bird whistle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not a melody like Rue\\'s \\nbut a simple two-note whistle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which we can use to \\ncommunicate that we\\'re all right. Fortunately, he\\'s \\ngood at this. Leaving him with the pack, I head off. \\n\\nI feel like I\\'m eleven again, tethered not to the safety \\nof the fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, \\nmaybe thirty yards of hunting space. Away from him \\nthough, the woods come alive with animal sounds. \\nReassured by his periodic whistles, I allow myself to \\ndrift farther away, and soon have two rabbits and a \\nfat squirrel to show for it. I decide it\\'s enough. I can \\nset snares and maybe get some fish. With Peeta\\'s \\nroots, this will be enough for now. \\n\\nAs I travel the short distance back, I realize we \\nhaven\\'t exchanged signals in a while. When my \\nwhistle receives no response, I run. In no time, I find \\nthe pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of \\nplastic has been laid on the ground where the sun \\ncan reach the single layer of berries that covers it. \\nBut where is he? \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Peeta!\" I call out in a panic. \"Peeta!\" I turn to the \\nrustle of brush and almost send an arrow through \\nhim. Fortunately, I pull my bow at the last second \\nand it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps \\nback, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage. \\n\\nMy fear comes out as anger. \"What are you doing? \\nYou\\'re supposed to be here, not running around in \\nthe woods!\" \\n\\n\"I found some berries down by the stream,\" he says, \\nclearly confused by my outburst. \\n\\n\"I whistled. Why didn\\'t you whistle back?\"Isnap at \\nhim. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t hear. The water\\'s too loud, I guess,\" he says. \\nHe crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. \\nThat\\'s when I feel that I\\'m trembling. \\n\\n\"I thought Cato killed you!\" I almost shout. \\n\\n\"No, I\\'m fine.\" Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I \\ndon\\'t respond. \"Katniss?\" \\n\\nI push away, trying to sort out my feelings. \"If two \\npeople agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because \\nif one of them doesn\\'t answer, they\\'re in trouble, all \\nright?\" \\n\\n\"All right!\" he says. \\n\\n\"All right. Because that\\'s what happened with Rue, \\nand I watched her die!\" I say. I turn away from him, \\ngo to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, \\nalthough I still have some in mine. But I\\'m not ready \\nto forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples \\nare untouched, but someone\\'s definitely picked away \\npart of the cheese. \"And you ate without me!\" I really \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t care, I just want something else to be mad \\nabout. \\n\\n\"What? No, I didn\\'t,\" Peeta says. \\n\\n\"Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what ate the cheese,\" Peeta says slowly \\nand distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, \"but \\nit wasn\\'t me. I\\'ve been down by the stream collecting \\nberries. Would you care for some?\" \\n\\nI would actually, but I don\\'t want to relent too soon. I \\ndo walk over and look at them. I\\'ve never seen this \\ntype before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These \\naren\\'t Rue\\'s berries, although they resemble them. \\nNor do they match any I learned about in training. I \\nlean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between \\nmy fingers. \\n\\nMy father\\'s voice comes back to me. \"Not these, \\nKatniss. Never these. They\\'re nightlock. You 11 be dead \\nbefore they reach your stomach.\" \\n\\nJust then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting \\nPeeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his \\neyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or \\nso away. What\\'s left of Foxface\\'s emaciated body is \\nlifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in \\nthe sunlight. \\n\\nI should have known the moment I saw the missing \\ncheese... . \\n\\nPeeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a \\ntree. \"Climb. He\\'ll be here in a second. Well stand a \\nbetter chance fighting him from above.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI stop him, suddenly calm. \"No, Peeta, she\\'s your kill, \\nnot Cato\\'s.\" \\n\\n\"What? I haven\\'t even seen her since the first day,\" he \\nsays. \"How could I have killed her?\" \\n\\nIn answer, I hold out the berries. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIt takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How \\nFoxface stole the food from the supply pile before I \\nblew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive \\nbut not enough that anyone would notice it, how she \\nwouldn\\'t question the safely of berries we were \\npreparing to eat ourselves. \\n\\n\"I wonder how she found us,\" says Peeta. \"My fault, I \\nguess, if I\\'m as loud as you say.\" \\n\\nWe were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, \\nbut I try to be kind. \"And she\\'s very clever, Peeta. \\nWell, she was. Until you outfoxed her.\" \\n\\n\"Not on purpose. Doesn\\'t seem fair somehow. I mean, \\nwe would have both been dead, too, if she hadn\\'t \\neaten the berries first.\" He checks himself. \"No, of \\ncourse, we wouldn\\'t. You recognized them, didn\\'t \\nyou?\" \\n\\nI give a nod. \"We call them nightlock.\" \\n\\n\"Even the name sounds deadly,\" he says. \"I\\'m sorry, \\nKatniss. I really thought they were the same ones \\nyou\\'d gathered.\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t apologize. It just means we\\'re one step closer to \\nhome, right?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll get rid of the rest,\" Peeta says. He gathers up the \\nsheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, \\nand goes to toss them into the woods. \\n\\n\"Wait!\" I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to \\nthe boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nof berries from the plastic. \"If they fooled Foxface, \\nmaybe they can fool Cato as well. If he\\'s chasing us or \\nsomething, we can act like we accidentally drop the \\npouch and if he eats them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \" \\n\\n\"Then hello District Twelve,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" I say, securing the pouch to my belt. \\n\\n\"He\\'ll know where we are now,\" says Peeta. \"If he was \\nanywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, he\\'ll know \\nwe killed her and come after us.\" \\n\\nPeeta\\'s right. This could be just the opportunity \\nCato\\'s been waiting for. But even if we run now, \\nthere\\'s the meat to cook and our fire will be another \\nsign of our whereabouts. \"Let\\'s make a fire. Right \\nnow.\" I begin to gather branches and brush. \\n\\n\"Are you ready to face him?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\"I\\'m ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we \\nhave the chance. If he knows we\\'re here, he knows. \\nBut he also knows there\\'s two of us and probably \\nassumes we were hunting Foxface. That means you\\'re \\nrecovered. And the fire means we\\'re not hiding, we\\'re \\ninviting him here. Would you show up?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Maybe not,\" he says. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the \\ndamp wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and \\nsquirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking \\nin the coals. We take turns gathering greens and \\nkeeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I anticipated, \\nhe doesn\\'t make an appearance. \\n\\nWhen the food\\'s cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving \\n\\nus each a rabbit\\'s leg to eat as we walk. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nI want to move higher into the woods, climb a good \\ntree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. \\n\"I can\\'t climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, \\nand I don\\'t think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet \\nabove the ground.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s not safe to stay in the open, Peeta,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Can\\'t we go back to the cave?\" he asks. \"It\\'s near \\nwater and easy to defend.\" \\n\\nI sigh. Several more hours of walking \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or should I \\nsay crashing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 through the woods to reach an area \\nwe\\'ll just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But \\nPeeta doesn\\'t ask for much. He\\'s followed my \\ninstructions all day and I\\'m sure if things were \\nreversed, he wouldn\\'t make me spend the night in a \\ntree. It dawns on me that I haven\\'t been very nice to \\nPeeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, \\nscreaming at him over disappearing. The playful \\nromance we had sustained in the cave has \\ndisappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with \\nthe threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has \\nprobably just about had it with me. And as for the \\naudience ... \\n\\nI reach up and give him a kiss. \"Sure. Let\\'s go back to \\nthe cave.\" \\n\\nHe looks pleased and relieved. \"Well, that was easy.\" \\n\\nI work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage \\nthe shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself \\nnow. \\n\\nWe toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be \\nsending off smoke for a few more hours, although I \\ndoubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we \\nreach the stream, I see the water has dropped \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nconsiderably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so I \\nsuggest we walk back in it. Peeta\\'s happy to oblige \\nand since he\\'s a lot quieter in water than on land, it\\'s \\na doubly good idea. It\\'s a long walk back to the cave \\nthough, even going downward, even with the rabbit to \\ngive us a boost. We\\'re both exhausted by our hike \\ntoday and still way too underfed. I keep my bow \\nloaded, both for Cato and any fish I might see, but the \\nstream seems strangely empty of creatures. \\n\\nBy the time we reach our destination, our feet are \\ndragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill \\nup our water bottles and climb the little slope to our \\nden. It\\'s not much, but out here in the wilderness, it\\'s \\nthe closest thing we have to a home. It will be warmer \\nthan a tree, too, because it provides some shelter \\nfrom the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from \\nthe west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through \\nPeeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the \\nhunt has taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping \\nbag and set aside the rest of his food for when he \\nwakes. He drops off immediately. I pull the sleeping \\nbag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the \\naudience, but for me. Because I\\'m so grateful that \\nhe\\'s still here, not dead by the stream as I\\'d thought. \\nSo glad that I don\\'t have to face Cato alone. \\n\\nBrutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist \\nof his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, \\nwho has had it out for me since the beginning. He \\nprobably has had a special hatred for me ever since I \\noutscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would \\nsimply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it drove \\nCato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of \\nhis ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown \\nup. The others were upset, of course, but he was \\ncompletely unhinged. I wonder now if Cato might not \\nbe entirely sane. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface \\nshine in the sky and then disappear from the world \\nforever. He hasn\\'t said it, but I don\\'t think Peeta felt \\ngood about killing her, even if it was essential. I can\\'t \\npretend I\\'ll miss her, but I have to admire her. My \\nguess is if they had given us some sort of test, she \\nwould have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in \\nfact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she\\'d \\nhave sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta\\'s \\nown ignorance that brought her down. I\\'ve spent so \\nmuch time making sure I don\\'t underestimate my \\nopponents that I\\'ve forgotten it\\'s just as dangerous to \\noverestimate them as well. \\n\\nThat brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had \\na sense of Foxface, who she was and how she \\noperated, he\\'s a little more slippery. Powerful, well \\ntrained, but smart? I don\\'t know. Not like she was. \\nAnd utterly lacking in the control Foxface \\ndemonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his \\njudgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel \\nsuperior on that point. I think of the moment I sent \\nthe arrow flying into the apple in the pig\\'s mouth \\nwhen I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato \\nbetter than I think. \\n\\nDespite the fatigue in my body, my mind\\'s alert, so I \\nlet Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a \\nsoft gray day has begun when I shake his shoulder. \\nHe looks out, almost in alarm. \"I slept the whole \\nnight. That\\'s not fair, Katniss, you should have woken \\nme.\" \\n\\nI stretch and burrow down into the bag. \"I\\'ll sleep \\nnow. Wake me if anything interesting happens.\" \\n\\nApparently nothing does, because when I open my \\neyes, bright hot afternoon light gleams through the \\nrocks. \"Any sign of our friend?\" I ask. \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta shakes his head. \"No, he\\'s keeping a \\ndisturbingly low profile.\" \\n\\n\"How long do you think well have before the \\nGamemakers drive us together?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there\\'s been \\nplenty of time for the audience to place bets and get \\nbored. I guess it could happen at any moment,\" says \\nPeeta. \\n\\n\"Yeah, I have a feeling today\\'s the day,\" I say. I sit up \\nand look out at the peaceful terrain. \"I wonder how \\nthey\\'ll do it.\" \\n\\nPeeta remains silent. There\\'s not really any good \\nanswer. \\n\\n\"Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting \\nday. But we should probably eat as much as we can \\nhold just in case we run into trouble,\" I say. \\n\\nPeeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. \\nThe rest of the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread \\nwith the last bit of cheese. The only thing I leave in \\nreserve is the squirrel and the apple. \\n\\nBy the time we\\'re done, all that\\'s left is a pile of rabbit \\nbones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my \\ngrowing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we don\\'t bathe \\ndaily in the Seam, but we keep cleaner than I have of \\nlate. Except for my feet, which have walked in the \\nstream, I\\'m covered in a layer of grime. \\n\\nLeaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I \\ndon\\'t think there will be another night in the arena \\nsomehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, I have \\nthe feeling 111 escape it today. I give the rocks a pat \\ngood-bye and we head down to the stream to wash \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nup. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. I \\nmay do my hair and braid it back wet. I\\'m wondering \\nif we might even be able to give our clothes a quick \\nscrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be \\nthe stream. Now there\\'s only a bone-dry bed. I put my \\nhand down to feel it. \\n\\n\"Not even a little damp. They must have drained it \\nwhile we slept,\" I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, \\naching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my \\nprevious dehydration creeps into my consciousness. \\nOur bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two \\ndrinking and this hot sun it won\\'t take long to deplete \\nthem. \\n\\n\"The lake,\" says Peeta. \"That\\'s where they want us to \\ngo.\" \\n\\n\"Maybe the ponds still have some,\" I say hopefully. \\n\\n\"We can check,\" he says, but he\\'s just humoring me. \\nI\\'m humoring myself because I know what I\\'ll find \\nwhen we return to the pond where I soaked my leg. A \\ndusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip \\nanyway just to confirm what we already know. \\n\\n\"You\\'re right. They\\'re driving us to the lake,\" I say. \\nWhere there\\'s no cover. Where they\\'re guaranteed a \\nbloody fight to the death with nothing to block their \\nview. \"Do you want to go straightaway or wait until \\nthe water\\'s tapped out?\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s go now, while we\\'ve had food and rest. Let\\'s just \\ngo end this thing,\" he says. \\n\\nI nod. It\\'s funny. I feel almost as if it\\'s the first day of \\nthe Games again. That I\\'m in the same position. \\nTwenty-one tributes are dead, but I still have yet to \\nkill Cato. And really, wasn\\'t he always the one to kill? \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nNow it seems the other tributes were just minor \\nobstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real \\nbattle of the Games. Cato and me. \\n\\nBut no, there\\'s the boy waiting beside me. I feel his \\narms wrap around me. \\n\\n\"Two against one. Should be a piece of cake,\" he says. \\n\"Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol,\" I answer. \\n\"You bet it will,\" he says. \\n\\nWe stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling \\neach other, the sunlight, the rustle of the leaves at \\nour feet. Then without a word, we break apart and \\nhead for the lake. \\n\\nI don\\'t care now that Peeta\\'s footfalls send rodents \\nscurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight \\nCato and I\\'d just as soon do it here as on the plain. \\nBut I doubt I\\'ll have that choice. If the Gamemakers \\nwant us in the open, then in the open we will be. \\n\\nWe stop to rest for a few moments under the tree \\nwhere the Careers trapped me. The husk of the \\ntracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy \\nrains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the \\nlocation. I touch it with the tip of my boot, and it \\ndissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the \\nbreeze. I can\\'t help looking up in the tree where Rue \\nsecretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker \\nj ackers. Glimmer\\'s bloated body. The terrifying \\nhallucinations ... \\n\\n\"Let\\'s move on,\" I say, wanting to escape the darkness \\nthat surrounds this place. Peeta doesn\\'t object. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nGiven our late start to the day, when we reach the \\nplain it\\'s already early evening. There\\'s no sign of \\nCato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia \\nglowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato \\ndecided to pull a Foxface on us, we circle the \\nCornucopia to make sure it\\'s empty. Then obediently, \\nas if following instructions, we cross to the lake and \\nfill our water containers. \\n\\nI frown at the shrinking sun. \"We don\\'t want to fight \\nhim after dark. There\\'s only the one pair of glasses.\" \\n\\nPeeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the \\nwater. \"Maybe that\\'s what he\\'s waiting for. What do \\nyou want to do? Go back to the cave?\" \\n\\n\"Either that or find a tree. But let\\'s give him another \\nhalf an hour or so. Then well take cover,\" I answer. \\n\\nWe sit by the lake, in full sight. There\\'s no point in \\nhiding now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can \\nsee the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies \\nback and forth between them like brightly colored \\nballs. I open my mouth and sing out Rue\\'s four-note \\nrun. I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of \\nmy voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in the \\nsilence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, \\nthen another. Then the whole world comes alive with \\nthe sound. \\n\\n\"Just like your father,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nMy fingers find the pin on my shirt. \"That\\'s Rue\\'s \\nsong,\" I say. \"I think they remember it.\" \\n\\nThe music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. \\nAs the notes overlap, they compliment one another, \\nforming a lovely, unearthly harmony. It was this \\nsound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nworkers of District 1 1 home each night. Does \\nsomeone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that \\nshe is dead? \\n\\nFor a while, I just close my eyes and listen, \\nmesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then \\nsomething begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off \\nin jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes intersperse \\nwith the melody. The mockingjays\\' voices rise up in a \\nshrieking cry of alarm. \\n\\nWe\\'re on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised \\nto shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and \\nbears down on us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands \\nare empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow \\nhits his chest and inexplicably falls aside. \\n\\n\"He\\'s got some kind of body armor!\" I shout to Peeta. \\n\\nJust in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace \\nmyself, but he rockets right between us with no \\nattempt to check his speed. I can tell from his \\npanting, the sweat pouring off his purplish face, that \\nhe\\'s been running hard a long time. Not toward us. \\nFrom something. But what? \\n\\nMy eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first \\ncreature leap onto the plain. As I\\'m turning away, I \\nsee another half dozen join it. Then I am stumbling \\nblindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to \\nsave myself. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuttations. No question about it. I\\'ve never seen \\nthese mutts, but they\\'re no natural-born animals. \\nThey resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and \\nthen balances easily on its hind legs? What wolf \\nwaves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw \\nas though it had a wrist? These things I can see at a \\ndistance. Up close, I\\'m sure their more menacing \\nattributes will be revealed. \\n\\nCato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and \\nwithout question I follow him. If he thinks it\\'s the \\nsafest place, who am I to argue? Besides, even if I \\ncould make it to the trees, it would be impossible for \\nPeeta to outrun them on that leg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Peeta! My hands \\nhave just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of \\nthe Cornucopia when I remember I\\'m part of a team. \\nHe\\'s about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast \\nas he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast. I \\nsend an arrow into the pack and one goes down, but \\nthere are plenty to take its place. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s waving me up the horn, \"Go, Katniss! Go!\" \\n\\nHe\\'s right. I can\\'t protect either of us on the ground. I \\nstart climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands \\nand feet. The pure gold surface has been designed to \\nresemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so \\nthere are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold \\non. But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels \\nhot enough to blister my hands. \\n\\nCato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, \\ntwenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his \\nbreath as he gags over the edge. Now\\'s my chance to \\nfinish him off. I stop midway up the horn and load \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nanother arrow, but just as I\\'m about to let it fly, I \\nhear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see he\\'s just \\nreached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels. \\n\\n\"Climb!\" I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only \\nthe leg but the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow \\ndown the throat of the first mutt that places its paws \\non the metal. As it dies the creature lashes out, \\ninadvertently opening gashes on a few of its \\ncompanions. That\\'s when I get a look at the claws. \\nFour inches and clearly razor-sharp. \\n\\nPeeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull \\nhim along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top \\nand whip around, but he\\'s doubled over with cramps \\nand apparently more preoccupied with the mutts \\nthan us. He coughs out something unintelligible. The \\nsnuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts isn\\'t \\nhelping. \\n\\n\"What?\" I shout at him. \\n\\n\"He said, \\'Can they climb it?\\'\" answers Peeta, drawing \\nmy focus back to the base of the horn. \\n\\nThe mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join \\ntogether, they raise up again to stand easily on their \\nback legs giving them an eerily human quality. Each \\nhas a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and \\nsleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black \\nto what I can only describe as blond. There\\'s \\nsomething else about them, something that makes \\nthe hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can\\'t \\nput my finger on it. \\n\\nThey put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and \\ntasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and \\nthen making high-pitched yipping sounds to one \\nanother. This must be how they communicate \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nbecause the pack backs up as if to make room. Then \\none of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of \\nblond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the \\nhorn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful \\nbecause it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink \\nlips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs \\nthere, and in that moment I realize what else \\nunsettled me about the mutts. The green eyes \\nglowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any \\ncanine I\\'ve ever seen. They are unmistakably human. \\nAnd that revelation has barely registered when I \\nnotice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels \\nand the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, \\nthe green eyes, the number ... it\\'s Glimmer. \\n\\nA shriek escapes my lips and I\\'m having trouble \\nholding the arrow in place. I have been waiting to fire, \\nonly too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows. \\nWaiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But \\nnow, even though the mutt has begun to slide \\nbackward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, \\neven though I can hear the slow screeching of the \\nclaws like nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. \\nIts body twitches and flops onto the ground with a \\nthud. \\n\\n\"Katniss?\" I can feel Peeta\\'s grip on my arm. \\n\"It\\'s her!\" I get out. \\n\"Who?\" asks Peeta. \\n\\nMy head snaps from side to side as I examine the \\npack, taking in the various sizes and colors. The \\nsmall one with the red coat and amber eyes . . . \\nFoxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes of \\nthe boy from District 9 who died as we struggled for \\nthe backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, \\nwith dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nthat reads 1 1 in woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. \\nRue ... \\n\\n\"What is it, Katniss?\" Peeta shakes my shoulder. \\n\\n\"It\\'s them. It\\'s all of them. The others. Rue and \\nFoxface and ... all of the other tributes,\" I choke out. \\n\\nI hear Peeta\\'s gasp of recognition. \"What did they do \\nto them? You don\\'t think . . . those could be their real \\neyes?\" \\n\\nTheir eyes are the least of my worries. What about \\ntheir brains? Have they been given any of the real \\ntributes memories? Have they been programmed to \\nhate our faces particularly because we have survived \\nand they were so callously murdered? And the ones \\nwe actually killed ... do they believe they\\'re avenging \\ntheir own deaths? \\n\\nBefore I can get this out, the mutts begin a new \\nassault on the horn. They\\'ve split into two groups at \\nthe sides of the horn and are using those powerful \\nhindquarters to launch themselves at us. A pair of \\nteeth ring together just inches from my hand and \\nthen I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, \\nthe heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the \\nside. If not for the grip on my arm, he\\'d be on the \\nground, but as it is, it takes all my strength to keep \\nus both on the curved back of the horn. And more \\ntributes are coming. \\n\\n\"Kill it, Peeta! Kill it!\" I\\'m shouting, and although I \\ncan\\'t quite see what\\'s happening, I know he must \\nhave stabbed the thing because the pull lessens. I\\'m \\nable to haul him back onto the horn where we drag \\nourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils \\nawaits. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nCato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing \\nis slowing and I know soon he\\'ll be recovered enough \\nto come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. \\nI arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a \\nmutt that can only be Thresh. Who else could jump \\nso high? I feel a moment\\'s relief because we must \\nfinally be up above the mutt line and I\\'m just turning \\nback to face Cato when Peeta\\'s jerked from my side. \\nI\\'m sure the pack has got him until his blood \\nsplatters my face. \\n\\nCato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, \\nholding Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his \\nair. Peeta\\'s clawing at Cato\\'s arm, but weakly, as if \\nconfused over whether it\\'s more important to breathe \\nor try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping \\nhole a mutt left in his calf. \\n\\nI aim one of my last two arrows at Cato\\'s head, \\nknowing it 11 have no effect on his trunk or limbs, \\nwhich I can now see are clothed in a skintight, flesh- \\ncolored mesh. Some high-grade body armor from the \\nCapitol. Was that what was in his pack at the feast? \\nBody armor to defend against my arrows? Well, they \\nneglected to send a face guard. \\n\\nCato just laughs. \"Shoot me and he goes down with \\nme.\" \\n\\nHe\\'s right. If I take him out and he falls to the mutts, \\nPeeta is sure to die with him. We\\'ve reached a \\nstalemate. I can\\'t shoot Cato without killing Peeta, \\ntoo. He can\\'t kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow \\nin his brain. We stand like statues, both of us seeking \\nan out. \\n\\nMy muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they \\nmight snap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nbreaking point. The mutts go silent and the only thing \\nI can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s lips are turning blue. If I don\\'t do something \\nquickly, hell die of asphyxiation and then 111 have \\nlost him and Cato will probably use his body as a \\nweapon against me. In fact, I\\'m sure this is Cato\\'s \\nplan because while he\\'s stopped laughing, his lips are \\nset in a triumphant smile. \\n\\nAs if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, \\ndripping with blood from his leg, up to Cato\\'s arm. \\nInstead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger \\nveers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of \\nCato\\'s hand. Cato realizes what it means exactly one \\nsecond after I do. I can tell by the way the smile drops \\nfrom his lips. But it\\'s one second too late because, by \\nthat time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out \\nand reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against \\nhim. For a horrible moment, I think they\\'re both going \\nover. I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as \\nCato loses his footing on the blood-slick horn and \\nplummets to the ground. \\n\\nWe hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, \\nand then the mutts attack him. Peeta and I hold on to \\neach other, waiting for the cannon, waiting for the \\ncompetition to finish, waiting to be released. But it \\ndoesn\\'t happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of \\nthe Hunger Games, and the audience expects a show. \\n\\nI don\\'t watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, \\nthe howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato \\ntakes on the mutt pack. I can\\'t understand how he \\ncan be surviving until I remember the body armor \\nprotecting him from ankle to neck and I realize what a \\nlong night this could be. Cato must have a knife or \\nsword or something, too, something he had hidden in \\nhis clothes, because on occasion there\\'s the death \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nscream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as \\nthe blade collides with the golden horn. The combat \\nmoves around the side of the Cornucopia, and I know \\nCato must be attempting the one maneuver that \\ncould save his life \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to make his way back around to \\nthe tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, \\ndespite his remarkable strength and skill, he is \\nsimply overpowered. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how long it has been, maybe an hour or \\nso, when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts \\ndragging him, dragging him back into the \\nCornucopia. Now they\\'ll finish him off, I think. But \\nthere\\'s still no cannon. \\n\\nNight falls and the anthem plays and there\\'s no \\npicture of Cato in the sky, only the faint moans \\ncoming through the metal beneath us. The icy air \\nblowing across the plain reminds me that the Games \\nare not over and may not be for who knows how long, \\nand there is still no guarantee of victory. \\n\\nI turn my attention to Peeta and discover his leg is \\nbleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, \\nremain down by the lake where we abandoned them \\nwhen we fled from the mutts. I have no bandage, \\nnothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. \\nAlthough I\\'m shaking in the biting wind, I rip off my \\njacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket \\nas swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my \\nteeth chattering beyond control. \\n\\nPeeta\\'s face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him \\nlie down before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery \\nblood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be \\nenough. I\\'ve seen my mother tie a tourniquet a \\nhandful of times and try to replicate it. I cut free a \\nsleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just \\nunder his knee, and tie a half knot. I don\\'t have a \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nstick, so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in \\nthe knot, twisting it as tightly as I dare. It\\'s risky \\nbusiness \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Peeta may end up losing his leg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but \\nwhen I weigh this against him losing his life, what \\nalternative do I have? I bandage the wound in the rest \\nof my shirt and lay down with him. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t go to sleep,\" I tell him. I\\'m not sure if this is \\nexactly medical protocol, but I\\'m terrified that if he \\ndrifts off hell never wake again. \\n\\n\"Are you cold?\" he asks. He unzips his jacket and I \\npress against him as he fastens it around me. It\\'s a \\nbit warmer, sharing our body heat inside my double \\nlayer of jackets, but the night is young. The \\ntemperature will continue to drop. \\n\\nEven now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so \\nwhen I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice. \\n\\n\"Cato may win this thing yet,\" I whisper to Peeta. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t you believe it,\" he says, pulling up my hood, \\nbut he\\'s shaking harder than I am. \\n\\nThe next hours are the worst in my life, which if you \\nthink about it, is saying something. The cold would be \\ntorture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to \\nCato, moaning, begging, and finally just whimpering \\nas the mutts work away at him. After a very short \\ntime, I don\\'t care who he is or what he\\'s done, all I \\nwant is for his suffering to end. \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t they just kill him?\" I ask Peeta. \\n\\n\"You know why,\" he says, and pulls me closer to him. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I do. No viewer could turn away from the show \\nnow. From the Gamemakers\\' point of view, this is the \\nfinal word in entertainment. \\n\\nIt goes on and on and on and eventually completely \\nconsumes my mind, blocking out memories and \\nhopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the \\npresent, which I begin to believe will never change. \\nThere will never be anything but cold and fear and \\nthe agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn. \\n\\nPeeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I \\nfind myself yelling his name louder and louder \\nbecause if he goes and dies on me now, I know 111 go \\ncompletely insane. He\\'s fighting it, probably more for \\nme than for him, and it\\'s hard because \\nunconsciousness would be its own form of escape. \\nBut the adrenaline pumping through my body would \\nnever allow me to follow him, so I can\\'t let him go. I \\njust can\\'t. \\n\\nThe only indication of the passage of time lies in the \\nheavens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins \\npointing it out to me, insisting I acknowledge its \\nprogress and sometimes, for just a moment I feel a \\nflicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs \\nme again. \\n\\nFinally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I \\nopen my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale \\nlight of dawn. I can see, too, how bloodless Peeta\\'s \\nface has become. How little time he has left. And I \\nknow I have to get him back to the Capitol. \\n\\nStill, no cannon has fired. I press my good ear against \\nthe horn and can just make out Cato\\'s voice. \\n\\n\"I think he\\'s closer now. Katniss, can you shoot \\nhim?\"Peeta asks. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIf he\\'s near the mouth, I may be able to take him out. \\nIt would be an act of mercy at this point. \\n\\n\"My last arrow\\'s in your tourniquet,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Make it count,\" says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, \\nletting me loose. \\n\\nSo I free the arrow, tying the tourniquet back as \\ntightly as my frozen fingers can manage. I rub my \\nhands together, trying to regain circulation. When I \\ncrawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge, I \\nfeel Peeta\\'s hands grip me for support. \\n\\nIt takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, \\nin the blood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to \\nbe my enemy makes a sound, and I know where his \\nmouth is. And I think the word he\\'s trying to say is \\nplease. \\n\\nPity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his \\nskull. Peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver \\nempty. \\n\\n\"Did you get him?\" he whispers. \\n\\nThe cannon fires in answer. \\n\\n\"Then we won, Katniss,\" he says hollowly. \\n\\n\"Hurray for us,\" I get out, but there\\'s no joy of victory \\nin my voice. \\n\\nA hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the \\nremaining mutts bound into it, disappearing as the \\nearth closes above them. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe wait, for the hovercraft to take Cato\\'s remains, for \\nthe trumpets of victory that should follow, but \\nnothing happens. \\n\\n\"Hey!\" I shout into air. \"What\\'s going on?\" The only \\nresponse is the chatter of waking birds. \\n\\n\"Maybe it\\'s the body. Maybe we have to move away \\nfrom it,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself \\nfrom the dead tribute on the final kill? My brain is too \\nmuddled to be sure, but what else could be the \\nreason for the delay? \\n\\n\"Okay. Think you could make it to the lake?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Think I better try,\" says Peeta. We inch down to the \\ntail of the horn and fall to the ground. If the stiffness \\nin my limbs is this bad, how can Peeta even move? I \\nrise first, swinging and bending my arms and legs \\nuntil I think I can help him up. Somehow, we make it \\nback to the lake. I scoop up a handful of the cold \\nwater for Peeta and bring a second to my lips. \\n\\nA mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of \\nrelief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes \\nCato\\'s body away. Now they will take us. Now we can \\ngo home. \\n\\nBut again there\\'s no response. \\n\\n\"What are they waiting for?\" says Peeta weakly. \\nBetween the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it \\ntook to get to the lake, his wound has opened up \\nagain. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" I say. Whatever the holdup is, I can\\'t \\n\\nwatch him lose any more blood. I get up to find a \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nstick but almost immediately come across the arrow \\nthat bounced off Cato\\'s body armor. It will do as well \\nas the other arrow. As I stoop to pick it up, Claudius \\nTemplesmith\\'s voice booms into the arena. \\n\\n\"Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy- \\nfourth Hunger Games. The earlier revision has been \\nrevoked. Closer examination of the rule book has \\ndisclosed that only one winner may be allowed,\" he \\nsays. \"Good luck and may the odds be ever in your \\nfavor.\" \\n\\nThere\\'s a small burst of static and then nothing more. \\nI stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They \\nnever intended to let us both live. This has all been \\ndevised by the Gamemakers to guarantee the most \\ndramatic showdown in history. And like a fool, I \\nbought into it. \\n\\n\"If you think about it, it\\'s not that surprising,\" he \\nsays softly. I watch as he painfully makes it to his \\nfeet. Then he\\'s moving toward me, as if in slow \\nmotion, his hand is pulling the knife from his belt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\n\\nBefore I am even aware of my actions, my bow is \\nloaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. \\nPeeta raises his eyebrows and I see the knife has \\nalready left his hand on its way to the lake where it \\nsplashes in the water. I drop my weapons and take a \\nstep back, my face burning in what can only be \\nshame. \\n\\n\"No,\" he says. \"Do it.\" Peeta limps toward me and \\nthrusts the weapons back in my hands. \\n\\n\"I can\\'t, I say. \"I won\\'t.\" \\n\\n\"Do it. Before they send those mutts back or \\n\\nsomething. I don\\'t want to die like Cato,\" he says. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then you shoot me,\" I say furiously, shoving the \\nweapons back at him. \"You shoot me and go home \\nand live with it!\"And as I say it, I know death right \\nhere, right now would be the easier of the two. \\n\\n\"You know I can\\'t,\" Peeta says, discarding the \\nweapons. \"Fine, I\\'ll go first anyway.\" He leans down \\nand rips the bandage off his leg, eliminating the final \\nbarrier between his blood and the earth. \\n\\n\"No, you can\\'t kill yourself,\" I say. I\\'m on my knees, \\ndesperately plastering the bandage back onto his \\nwound. \\n\\n\"Katniss,\" he says. \"It\\'s what I want.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re not leaving me here alone,\" I say. Because if \\nhe dies, 111 never go home, not really. Ill spend the \\nrest of my life in this arena trying to think my way \\nout. \\n\\n\"Listen,\" he says pulling me to my feet. \"We both \\nknow they have to have a victor. It can only be one of \\nus. Please, take it. For me.\" And he goes on about \\nhow he loves me, what life would be without me but \\nI\\'ve stopped listening because his previous words are \\ntrapped in my head, thrashing desperately around. \\n\\nWe both know they have to have a victor. \\n\\nYes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the \\nwhole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers\\' faces. \\nThey\\'d have failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be \\nexecuted, slowly and painfully while the cameras \\nbroadcast it to every screen in the country. \\n\\nIf Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we \\nwere ... \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMy fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing \\nit. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. \\n\"No, I won\\'t let you.\" \\n\\n\"Trust me,\" I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long \\nmoment then lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch \\nand pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. \\nThen I fill my own. \"On the count of three?\" \\n\\nPeeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. \\n\"The count of three,\" he says. \\n\\nWe stand, our backs pressed together, our empty \\nhands locked tight. \\n\\n\"Hold them out. I want everyone to see,\" he says. \\n\\nI spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten \\nin the sun. I give Peeta\\'s hand one last squeeze as a \\nsignal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. \"One.\" \\nMaybe I\\'m wrong. \"Two. \"Maybe they don\\'t care if we \\nboth die. \"Three!\" It\\'s too late to change my mind. I lift \\nmy hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the \\nworld. The berries have just passed my lips when the \\ntrumpets begin to blare. \\n\\nThe frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts \\nabove them. \"Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am \\npleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth \\nHunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I \\ngive you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the tributes of District Twelve!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue \\nwith the end of my shirt to make sure no juice \\nremains. Peeta pulls me to the lake where we both \\nflush our mouths with water and then collapse into \\neach other\\'s arms. \\n\\n\"You didn\\'t swallow any?\" I ask him. \\n\\nHe shakes his head. \"You?\" \\n\\n\"Guess I\\'d be dead by now if I did,\" I say. I can see his \\nlips moving in reply, but I can\\'t hear him over the \\nroar of the crowd in the Capitol that they\\'re playing \\nlive over the speakers. \\n\\nThe hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders \\ndrop, only there\\'s no way I\\'m letting go of Peeta. I \\nkeep one arm around him as I help him up, and we \\neach place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The \\nelectric current freezes us in place, and this time I\\'m \\nglad because I\\'m not really sure Peeta can hang on for \\nthe whole ride. And since my eyes were looking down, \\nI can see that while our muscles are immobile, \\nnothing is preventing the blood from draining out of \\nPeeta\\'s leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes \\nbehind us and the current stops, he slumps to the \\nfloor unconscious. \\n\\nMy fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so \\ntightly that when they take him away it tears leaving \\nme with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile \\nwhite, masked and gloved, already prepped to \\noperate, go into action. Peeta\\'s so pale and still on a \\nsilver table, tubes and wires springing out of him \\nevery which way, and for a moment I forget we\\'re out \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nof the Games and I see the doctors as just one more \\nthreat, one more pack of mutts designed to kill him. \\nPetrified, I lunge for him, but I\\'m caught and thrust \\nback into another room, and a glass door seals \\nbetween us. I pound on the glass, screaming my head \\noff. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol \\nattendant who appears behind me and offers me a \\nbeverage. \\n\\nI slump down on the floor, my face against the door, \\nstaring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my \\nhand. Icy cold, filled with orange juice, a straw with a \\nfrilly white collar. How wrong it looks in my bloody, \\nfilthy hand with its dirt-caked nails and scars. My \\nmouth waters at the smell, but I place it carefully on \\nthe floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty. \\n\\nThrough the glass, I see the doctors working \\nfeverishly on Peeta, their brows creased in \\nconcentration. I see the flow of liquids, pumping \\nthrough the tubes, watch a wall of dials and lights \\nthat mean nothing to me. I\\'m not sure, but I think his \\nheart stops twice. \\n\\nIt\\'s like being home again, when they bring in the \\nhopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion, \\nor the woman in her third day of labor, or the \\nfamished child struggling against pneumonia and my \\nmother and Prim, they wear that same look on their \\nfaces. Now is the time to run away to the woods, to \\nhide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in \\nanother part of the Seam the hammers make the \\ncoffin. But I\\'m held here both by the hovercraft walls \\nand the same force that holds the loved ones of the \\ndying. How often I\\'ve seen them, ringed around our \\nkitchen table and I thought, Why don\\'t they leave? \\nWhy do they stay to watch? \\n\\nAnd now I know. It\\'s because you have no choice. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nI startle when I catch someone staring at me from \\nonly a few inches away and then realize it\\'s my own \\nface reflecting back in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow \\ncheeks, my hair in a tangled mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. \\nNo wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from \\nme. \\n\\nThe next thing I know we\\'ve landed back on the roof \\nof the Training Center and they\\'re taking Peeta but \\nleaving me behind the door. I start hurling myself \\nagainst the glass, shrieking and I think I just catch a \\nglimpse of pink hair \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it must be Effie, it has to be \\nEffie coming to my rescue \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the needle jabs me \\nfrom behind. \\n\\nWhen I wake, I\\'m afraid to move at first. The entire \\nceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to \\nsee that I\\'m in a room containing just my bed. No \\ndoors, no windows are visible. The air smells of \\nsomething sharp and antiseptic. My right arm has \\nseveral tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I\\'m \\nnaked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my \\nskin. I tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. \\nNot only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are \\nfiled in perfect ovals, the scars from the burns are \\nless prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips, the \\npuckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just \\nrunning my fingers through my silken hair when I \\nfreeze. Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear. \\nNo, it wasn\\'t an illusion. I can hear again. \\n\\nI try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining \\nband around my waist keeps me from rising more \\nthan a few inches. The physical confinement makes \\nme panic and I\\'m trying to pull myself up and wriggle \\nmy hips through the band when a portion of the wall \\nslides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl \\ncarrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop \\ntrying to escape. I want to ask her a million \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nquestions, but I\\'m afraid any familiarity would cause \\nher harm. Obviously I am being closely monitored. \\nShe sets the tray across my thighs and presses \\nsomething that raises me to a sitting position. While \\nshe adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it \\nout loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so \\nnothing will seem secretive. \"Did Peeta make it?\" She \\ngives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my \\nhand, I feel the pressure of friendship. \\n\\nI guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta \\nhas made it. Of course, he did. With all their \\nexpensive equipment here. Still, I hadn\\'t been sure \\nuntil now. \\n\\nAs the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after \\nher and I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear \\nbroth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of \\nwater. This is it? I think grouchily. Shouldn\\'t my \\nhomecoming dinner be a little more spectacular? But \\nI find it\\'s an effort to finish the spare meal before me. \\nMy stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a \\nchestnut, and I have to wonder how long I\\'ve been out \\nbecause I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable \\nbreakfast that last morning in the arena. There\\'s \\nusually a lag of a few days between the end of the \\ncompetition and the presentation of the victor so that \\nthey can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person \\nback together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia \\nwill be creating our wardrobes for the public \\nappearances. Haymitch and Effie will be arranging \\nthe banquet for our sponsors, reviewing the questions \\nfor our final interviews. Back home, District 12 is \\nprobably in chaos as they try and organize the \\nhomecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given that \\nthe last one was close to thirty years ago. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHome! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought \\nof Prim\\'s scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon I will \\nbe home! \\n\\nI want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, \\nto find out more about what\\'s been going on. And why \\nshouldn\\'t I? I feel fine. But as I start to work my way \\nout of the band, I feel a cold liquid seeping into my \\nvein from one of the tubes and almost immediately \\nlose consciousness. \\n\\nThis happens on and off for an indeterminate amount \\nof time. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist \\nthe impulse to try and escape the bed, being knocked \\nout again. I seem to be in a strange, continual \\ntwilight. Only a few things register. The redheaded \\nAvox girl has not returned since the feeding, my scars \\nare disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a \\nman\\'s voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in \\nthe rougher cadences of home. And I can\\'t help \\nhaving a vague, comforting feeling that someone is \\nlooking out for me. \\n\\nThen finally, the time arrives when I come to and \\nthere\\'s nothing plugged into my right arm. The \\nrestraint around my middle has been removed and I \\nam free to move about. I start to sit up but am \\narrested by the sight of my hands. The skin\\'s \\nperfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the \\nscars from the arena gone, but those accumulated \\nover years of hunting have vanished without a trace. \\nMy forehead feels like satin, and when I try to find the \\nburn on my calf, there\\'s nothing. \\n\\nI slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will \\nbear my weight and find them strong and steady. \\nLying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me \\nflinch. It\\'s what all of us tributes wore in the arena. I \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nstare at it as if it had teeth until I remember that, of \\ncourse, this is what I will wear to greet my team. \\n\\nI\\'m dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in \\nfront of the wall where I know there\\'s a door even if I \\ncan\\'t see it when suddenly it slides open. I step into a \\nwide, deserted hall that appears to have no other \\ndoors on it. But it must. And behind one of them \\nmust be Peeta. Now that I\\'m conscious and moving, \\nI\\'m growing more and more anxious about him. He \\nmust be all right or the Avox girl wouldn\\'t have said \\nso. But I need to see him for myself. \\n\\n\"Peeta!\" I call out, since there\\'s no one to ask. I hear \\nmy name in response, but it\\'s not his voice. It\\'s a \\nvoice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness. \\nEffie. \\n\\nI turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at \\nthe end of the hall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My \\nfeet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should \\nshow more restraint, more superiority, especially \\nwhen she knows this will be on tape, but I don\\'t care. \\nI run for them and surprise even myself when I \\nlaunch into Haymitch \\'s arms first. When he whispers \\nin my ear, \"Nice job, sweetheart,\" it doesn\\'t sound \\nsarcastic. Effie\\'s somewhat teary and keeps patting \\nmy hair and talking about how she told everyone we \\nwere pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesn\\'t say \\nanything. Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad \\nfeeling. \\n\\n\"Where\\'s Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, \\nisn\\'t he? I mean, he\\'s alive?\" I blurt out. \\n\\n\"He\\'s fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on \\nair at the ceremony,\" says Haymitch. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh. That\\'s all,\" I say. The awful moment of thinking \\nPeeta\\'s dead again passes. \"I guess I\\'d want to see \\nthat myself.\" \\n\\n\"Go on with Cinna. He has to get you ready,\" says \\nHaymitch. \\n\\nIt\\'s a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his \\nprotective arm around my shoulders as he guides me \\naway from the cameras, down a few passages and to \\nan elevator that leads to the lobby of the Training \\nCenter. The hospital then is far underground, even \\nbeneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying \\nknots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby \\nare darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. \\nNo one else is there to see us cross to the tribute \\nelevator. Our footsteps echo in the emptiness. And \\nwhen we ride up to the twelfth floor, the faces of all \\nthe tributes who will never return flash across my \\nmind and there\\'s a heavy, tight place in my chest. \\n\\nWhen the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and \\nOctavia engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically \\nI can\\'t make out their words. The sentiment is clear \\nthough. They are truly thrilled to see me and I\\'m \\nhappy to see them, too, although not like I was to see \\nCinna. It\\'s more in the way one might be glad to see \\nan affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly \\ndifficult day. \\n\\nThey sweep me into the dining room and I get a real \\nmeal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 roast beef and peas and soft rolls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although \\nmy portions are still being strictly controlled. Because \\nwhen I ask for seconds, I\\'m refused. \\n\\n\"No, no, no. They don\\'t want it all coming back up on \\nthe stage,\" says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an \\nextra roll under the table to let me know she\\'s on my \\nside. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a \\nwhile as the prep team gets me ready. \\n\\n\"Oh, they did a full body polish on you,\" says Flavius \\nenviously. \"Not a flaw left on your skin.\" \\n\\nBut when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I \\ncan see is how skinny I am. I mean, I\\'m sure I was \\nworse when I came out of the arena, but I can easily \\ncount my ribs. \\n\\nThey take care of the shower settings for me, and they \\ngo to work on my hair, nails, and makeup when I\\'m \\ndone. They chatter so continuously that I barely have \\nto reply, which is good, since I don\\'t feel very \\ntalkative. It\\'s funny, because even though they\\'re \\nrattling on about the Games, it\\'s all about where they \\nwere or what they were doing or how they felt when a \\nspecific event occurred. \"I was still in bed!\" \"I had just \\nhad my eyebrows dyed!\" \"I swear I nearly fainted!\" \\nEverything is about them, not the dying boys and \\ngirls in the arena. \\n\\nWe don\\'t wallow around in the Games this way in \\nDistrict 12. We grit our teeth and watch because we \\nmust and try to get back to business as soon as \\npossible when they\\'re over. To keep from hating the \\nprep team, I effectively tune out most of what they\\'re \\nsaying. \\n\\nCinna comes in with what appears to be an \\nunassuming yellow dress across his arms. \\n\\n\"Have you given up the whole \\'girl on fire\\' thing?\" I \\nask. \\n\\n\"You tell me,\" he says, and slips it over my head. I \\nimmediately notice the padding over my breasts, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nadding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. \\nMy hands go to my chest and I frown. \\n\\n\"I know,\" says Cinna before I can object. \"But the \\nGamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. \\nHaymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This \\nwas the compromise.\" He stops me before I can look \\nat my reflection. \"Wait, don\\'t forget the shoes. \"Venia \\nhelps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I turn \\nto the mirror. \\n\\nI am still the \"girl on fire.\" The sheer fabric softly \\nglows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a \\nripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot \\ncostume seems garish, the interview dress too \\ncontrived. In this dress, I give the illusion of wearing \\ncandlelight. \\n\\n\"What do you think?\" asks Cinna. \\n\\n\"I think it\\'s the best yet,\" I say. When I manage to pull \\nmy eyes away from the flickering fabric, I\\'m in for \\nsomething of a shock. My hair\\'s loose, held back by a \\nsimple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the \\nsharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. \\nThe sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my \\nwaist, largely eliminating any help the padding would \\nhave given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. \\nWithout heels, you can see my true stature. I look, \\nvery simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the \\nmost. Innocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that \\nCinna has pulled this off when you remember I\\'ve just \\nwon the Games. \\n\\nThis is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs \\nis arbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his \\nmotivation. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it\\'d be something more ... sophisticated- \\nlooking,\" I say. \\n\\n\"I thought Peeta would like this better,\" he answers \\ncarefully. \\n\\nPeeta? No, it\\'s not about Peeta. It\\'s about the Capitol \\nand the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do \\nnot yet understand Cinna\\'s design, it\\'s a reminder the \\nGames are not quite finished. And beneath his benign \\nreply, I sense a warning. Of something he can\\'t even \\nmention in front of his own team. \\n\\nWe take the elevator to the level where we trained. It\\'s \\ncustomary for the victor and his or her support team \\nto rise from beneath the stage. First the prep team, \\nfollowed by the escort, the stylist, the mentor, and \\nfinally the victor. Only this year, with two victors who \\nshare both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing \\nhas had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly lit \\narea under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has \\nbeen installed to transport me upward. You can still \\nsee small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna \\nand the prep team peel off to change into their own \\ncostumes and take their positions, leaving me alone. \\nIn the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten yards \\naway and assume Peeta\\'s behind it. \\n\\nThe rumbling of the crowd is loud, so I don\\'t notice \\nHaymitch until he touches my shoulder. I spring \\naway, startled, still half in the arena, I guess. \\n\\n\"Easy, just me. Let\\'s have a look at you,\" Haymitch \\nsays. I hold out my arms and turn once. \"Good \\nenough.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s not much of a compliment. \"But what?\" I say. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch\\'s eyes shift around my musty holding \\nspace, and he seems to make a decision. \"But \\nnothing. How about a hug for luck?\" \\n\\nOkay, that\\'s an odd request from Haymitch but, after \\nall, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. \\nOnly, when I put my arms around his neck, I find \\nmyself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, \\nvery fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing \\nhis lips. \\n\\n\"Listen up. You\\'re in trouble. Word is the Capitol\\'s \\nfurious about you showing them up in the arena. The \\none thing they can\\'t stand is being laughed at and \\nthey\\'re the joke of Panem,\"says Haymitch. \\n\\nI feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as \\nthough Haymitch is saying something completely \\ndelightful because nothing is covering my mouth. \"So, \\nwhat?\" \\n\\n\"Your only defense can be you were so madly in love \\nyou weren\\'t responsible for your actions.\" Haymitch \\npulls back and adjusts my hairband. \"Got it, \\nsweetheart?\" He could be talking about anything now. \\n\\n\"Got it,\" I say. \"Did you tell Peeta this?\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t have to,\" says Haymitch. \"He\\'s already there.\" \\n\\n\"But you think I\\'m not?\" I say, taking the opportunity \\nto straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have \\nwrestled him into. \\n\\n\"Since when does it matter what I think?\" says \\nHaymitch. \"Better take our places.\" He leads me to the \\nmetal circle. \"This is your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it.\" \\nHe kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the \\ngloom. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to \\ncover the knocking in my knees. Then I realize it\\'s \\npointless. My whole body\\'s shaking like a leaf. \\nHopefully, it will be put down to excitement. After all, \\nit\\'s my night. \\n\\nThe damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens \\nto choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my \\nskin and I can\\'t rid myself of the feeling that the \\nboards above my head are about to collapse, to bury \\nme alive under the rubble. When I left the arena, \\nwhen the trumpets played, I was supposed to be safe. \\nFrom then on. For the rest of my life. But if what \\nHaymitch says is true, and he\\'s got no reason to lie, \\nI\\'ve never been in such a dangerous place in my life. \\n\\nIt\\'s so much worse than being hunted in the arena. \\nThere, I could only die. End of story. But out here \\nPrim, my mother, Gale, the people of District 12, \\neveryone I care about back home could be punished if \\nI can\\'t pull off the girl-driven-crazy-by-love scenario \\nHaymitch has suggested. \\n\\nSo I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, \\nwhen I poured out those berries, I was only thinking \\nof outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions \\nwould reflect on the Capitol. But the Hunger Games \\nare their weapon and you are not supposed to be able \\nto defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if they\\'ve \\nbeen in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated \\nthe whole event, right down to the double suicide. But \\nthat will only work if I play along with them. \\n\\nAnd Peeta ... Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. \\nBut what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had \\ntold Peeta the situation? That he had to pretend to be \\ndesperately in love? \\n\\n\"Don\\'t have to. He\\'s already there.\" \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nAlready thinking ahead of me in the Games again and \\nwell aware of the danger we\\'re in? Or ... already \\ndesperately in love? I don\\'t know. I haven\\'t even \\nbegun to separate out my feelings about Peeta. It\\'s too \\ncomplicated. What I did as part of the Games. As \\nopposed to what I did out of anger at the Capitol. Or \\nbecause of how it would be viewed back in District 12. \\nOr simply because it was the only decent thing to do. \\nOr what I did because I cared about him. \\n\\n\\n\\nThese are questions to be unraveled back home, in \\nthe peace and quiet of the woods, when no one is \\nwatching. Not here with every eye upon me. But I \\nwon\\'t have that luxury for who knows how long. And \\nright now, the most dangerous part of the Hunger \\nGames is about to begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear \\nCaesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he \\nknow how crucial it is to get every word right from \\nnow on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd \\nbreaks into applause as the prep teams are \\npresented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia \\nbouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing \\nbows. It\\'s a safe bet they\\'re clueless. Then Effie\\'s \\nintroduced. How long she\\'s waited for this moment. I \\nhope she\\'s able to enjoy it because as misguided as \\nEffie can be, she has a very keen instinct about \\ncertain things and must at least suspect we\\'re in \\ntrouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of \\ncourse, they\\'ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I \\nnow understand Cinna \\'s choice of dress for me for \\ntonight. Ill need to look as girlish and innocent as \\npossible. Haymitch\\'s appearance brings a round of \\nstomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, he\\'s \\naccomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two \\ntributes alive. What if he hadn\\'t warned me in time? \\nWould I have acted differently? Flaunted the moment \\nwith the berries in the Capitol\\'s face? No, I don\\'t think \\nso. But I could easily have been a lot less convincing \\nthan I need to be now. Right now. Because I can feel \\nthe plate lifting me up to the stage. \\n\\nBlinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal \\nunder my feet. Then there\\'s Peeta just a few yards \\naway. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, I \\ncan hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same \\nwhether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it, I \\ntake about three steps and fling myself into his arms. \\nHe staggers back, almost losing his balance, and \\nthat\\'s when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his \\nhand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\njust cling to each other while the audience goes \\ninsane. He\\'s kissing me and all the time I\\'m thinking, \\nDo you know? Do you know how much danger we\\'re \\nin? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar \\nFlickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the \\nshow, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even \\nglancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether \\nhe knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd \\nexactly right. \\n\\nFinally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good- \\nnatured shove toward the victor\\'s chair. Usually, this \\nis a single, ornate chair from which the winning \\ntribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, \\nbut since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have \\nprovided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my \\nmother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close \\nto Peeta that I\\'m practically on his lap, but one look \\nfrom Haymitch tells me it isn\\'t enough. Kicking off my \\nsandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head \\nagainst Peeta\\'s shoulder. His arm goes around me \\nautomatically, and I feel like I\\'m back in the cave, \\ncurled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt \\nis made of the same yellow material as my dress, but \\nPortia\\'s put him in long black pants. No sandals, \\neither, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps \\nsolidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given \\nme a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy \\ndress. But I guess that was the point. \\n\\nCaesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then \\nit\\'s time for the show. This will last exactly three \\nhours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the \\nlights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I \\nrealize I\\'m unprepared for this. I do not want to watch \\nmy twenty- two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of \\nthem die the first time. My heart starts pounding and \\nI have a strong impulse to run. How have the other \\nvictors faced this alone? During the highlights, they \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nperiodically show the winner\\'s reaction up on a box in \\nthe corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years \\n. . . some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the \\nair, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All \\nI know is that the only thing keeping me on this love \\nseat is Peeta \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his arm around my shoulder, his \\nother hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the \\nprevious victors didn\\'t have the Capitol looking for a \\nway to destroy them. \\n\\nCondensing several weeks into three hours is quite a \\nfeat, especially when you consider how many cameras \\nwere going at once. Whoever puts together the \\nhighlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. \\nThis year, for the first time, they tell a love story. I \\nknow Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate amount \\nof time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I\\'m \\nglad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in- \\nlove thing that\\'s my defense for defying the Capitol, \\nplus it means we won\\'t have as much time to linger \\nover the deaths. \\n\\nThe first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena \\nevents, the reaping, the chariot ride through the \\nCapitol, our training scores, and our interviews. \\nThere\\'s this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under \\nit that makes it twice as awful because, of course, \\nalmost everyone on-screen is dead. \\n\\nOnce we\\'re in the arena, there\\'s detailed coverage of \\nthe bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically \\nalternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of \\nus. Mostly Peeta really, there\\'s no question he\\'s \\ncarrying this romance thing on his shoulders. Now I \\nsee what the audience saw, how he misled the \\nCareers about me, stayed awake the entire night \\nunder the tracker j acker tree, fought Cato to let me \\nescape and even while he lay in that mud bank, \\nwhispered my name in his sleep. I seem heartless in \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\ncomparison \\xe2\\x80\\x94 dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and \\nblowing up supplies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 until I go hunting for Rue. \\nThey play her death in full, the spearing, my failed \\nrescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from \\nDistrict 1 \\'s throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my \\narms. And the song. I get to sing every note of the \\nsong. Something inside me shuts down and I\\'m too \\nnumb to feel anything. It\\'s like watching complete \\nstrangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice \\nthey omit the part where I covered her in flowers. \\n\\nRight. Because even that smacks of rebellion. \\n\\nThings pick up for me once they\\'ve announced two \\ntributes from the same district can live and I shout \\nout Peeta\\'s name and then clap my hands over my \\nmouth. If I\\'ve seemed indifferent to him earlier, I \\nmake up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back \\nto health, going to the feast for the medicine, and \\nbeing very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see \\nthe mutts and Cato\\'s death are as gruesome as ever, \\nbut again, I feel it happens to people I have never met. \\n\\nAnd then comes the moment with the berries. I can \\nhear the audience hushing one another, not wanting \\nto miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the \\nfilmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with \\nthe announcement of our victory, but with me \\npounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, \\nscreaming Peeta\\'s name as they try to revive him. \\n\\nIn terms of survival, it\\'s my best moment all night. \\n\\nThe anthem\\'s playing yet again and we rise as \\nPresident Snow himself takes the stage followed by a \\nlittle girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. \\nThere\\'s just one crown, though, and you can hear the \\ncrowd\\'s confusion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose head will he place it on? \\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 until President Snow gives it a twist and it \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nseparates into two halves. He places the first around \\nPeeta\\'s brow with a smile. He\\'s still smiling when he \\nsettles the second on my head, but his eyes, just \\ninches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snake\\'s. \\n\\nThat\\'s when I know that even though both of us \\nwould have eaten the berries, I am to blame for \\nhaving the idea. I\\'m the instigator. I\\'m the one to be \\npunished. \\n\\nMuch bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about \\nto fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally \\nbids the audience good night, reminding them to tune \\nin tomorrow for the final interviews. As if they have a \\nchoice. \\n\\nPeeta and I are whisked to the president\\'s mansion \\nfor the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time \\nto eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous \\nsponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try \\nto get their picture with us. Face after beaming face \\nflashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the \\nevening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of \\nHaymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, \\nwhich is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking \\npeople and smiling as my picture is taken. The one \\nthing I never do is let go of Peeta\\'s hand. \\n\\nThe sun is just peeking over the horizon when we \\nstraggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training \\nCenter. I think now 111 finally get a word alone with \\nPeeta, but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get \\nsomething fitted for the interview and personally \\nescorts me to my door. \\n\\n\"Why can\\'t I talk to him?\" I ask. \\n\\n\"Plenty of time for talk when we get home,\" says \\n\\nHaymitch. \"Go to bed, you\\'re on air at two.\" \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nDespite Haymitch\\'s running interference, I\\'m \\ndetermined to see Peeta privately. After I toss and \\nturn for a few hours, I slip into the hall. My first \\nthought is to check the roof, but it\\'s empty. Even the \\ncity streets far below are deserted after the \\ncelebration last night. I go back to bed for a while and \\nthen decide to go directly to his room, but when I try \\nto turn the knob, I find my own bedroom door has \\nbeen locked from the outside. I suspect Haymitch \\ninitially, but then there\\'s a more insidious fear that \\nthe Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. I\\'ve \\nbeen unable to escape since the Hunger Games \\nbegan, but this feels different, much more personal. \\nThis feels like I\\'ve been imprisoned for a crime and \\nI\\'m awaiting sentencing. I quickly get back in bed and \\npretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me \\nto the start of another \"big, big, big day!\" \\n\\nI have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain \\nand stew before the prep team descends. All I have to \\nsay is, \"The crowd loved you!\" and it\\'s unnecessary to \\nspeak for the next couple of hours. When Cinna \\ncomes in, he shoos them out and dresses me in a \\nwhite, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he \\npersonally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate \\na soft, rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but I\\'m \\nafraid to ask him anything of real importance because \\nafter the incident with the door, I can\\'t shake the \\nfeeling that I\\'m being watched constantly. \\n\\nThe interview takes place right down the hall in the \\nsitting room. A space has been cleared and the love \\nseat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of \\nred and pink roses. There are only a handful of \\ncameras to record the event. No live audience at least. \\n\\nCaesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. \\ncome in. \"Congratulations, Katniss. How are you \\nfaring?\" \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fine. Nervous about the interview,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be. We\\'re going to have a fabulous time,\" he \\nsays, giving my cheek a reassuring pat. \\n\\n\"I\\'m not good at talking about myself,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Nothing you say will be wrong,\" he says. \\n\\nAnd I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But \\nactually, President Snow may be arranging some sort \\nof\\'accident\" for me as we speak. \\n\\nThen Peeta\\'s there looking handsome in red and \\nwhite, pulling me off to the side. \"I hardly get to see \\nyou. Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart.\" \\n\\nHaymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but \\nthere are too many ears listening, so I just say, \"Yes, \\nhe\\'s gotten very responsible lately.\" \\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s just this and we go home. Then he can\\'t \\nwatch us all the time,\" says Peeta. \\n\\nI feel a sort of shiver run through me and there\\'s no \\ntime to analyze why, because they\\'re ready for us. We \\nsit somewhat formally on the love seat, but Caesar \\nsays, \"Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you \\nwant. It looked very sweet.\" So I tuck my feet up and \\nPeeta pulls me in close to him. \\n\\nSomeone counts backward and just like that, we\\'re \\nbeing broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar \\nFlickerman is wonderful, teasing, joking, getting \\nchoked up when the occasion presents itself. He and \\nPeeta already have the rapport they established that \\nnight of the first interview, that easy banter, so I just \\nsmile a lot and try to speak as little as possible. I \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nmean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I \\nredirect the conversation back to Peeta. \\n\\nEventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions \\nthat insist on fuller answers. \"Well, Peeta, we know, \\nfrom our days in the cave, that it was love at first \\nsight for you from what, age five?\" Caesar says. \\n\\n\"From the moment I laid eyes on her,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"But, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real \\nexcitement for the audience was watching you fall for \\nhim. When did you realize you were in love with him?\" \\nasks Caesar. \\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s a hard one ...\" I give a faint, breathy laugh \\nand look down at my hands. Help. \\n\\n\"Well, I know when it hit me. The night when you \\nshouted out his name from that tree,\" says Caesar. \\n\\nThank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. \\n\"Yes, I guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I \\njust tried not to think about what my feelings might \\nbe, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only \\nmade things worse if I actually cared about him. But \\nthen, in the tree, everything changed,\" I say. \\n\\n\"Why do you think that was?\" urges Caesar. \\n\\n\"Maybe . . . because for the first time . . . there was a \\nchance I could keep him,\" I say. \\n\\nBehind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of \\nhuff with relief and I know I\\'ve said the right thing. \\nCaesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a \\nmoment because he\\'s so moved. I can feel Peeta press \\nhis forehead into my temple and he asks, \"So now \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nthat you\\'ve got me, what are you going to do with \\nme?\" \\n\\nI turn in to him. \"Put you somewhere you can\\'t get \\nhurt.\" And when he kisses me, people in the room \\nactually sigh. \\n\\nFor Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all \\nthe ways we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to \\nstings, to wounds. But it\\'s not until we get around to \\nthe mutts that I forget I\\'m on camera. When Caesar \\nasks Peeta how his \"new leg\" is working out. \\n\\n\"New leg?\" I say, and I can\\'t help reaching out and \\npulling up the bottom of Peeta\\'s pants. \"Oh, no,\" I \\nwhisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that \\nhas replaced his flesh. \\n\\n\"No one told you?\" asks Caesar gently. I shake my \\nhead. \\n\\n\"I haven\\'t had the chance,\" says Peeta with a slight \\nshrug. \\n\\n\"It\\'s my fault,\" I say. \"Because I used that tourniquet.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, it\\'s your fault I\\'m alive,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He\\'s right,\" says Caesar. \"He\\'d have bled to death for \\nsure without it.\" \\n\\nI guess this is true, but I can\\'t help feeling upset \\nabout it to the extent that I\\'m afraid I might cry and \\nthen I remember everyone in the country is watching \\nme so I just bury my face in Peeta\\'s shirt. It takes \\nthem a couple of minutes to coax me back out \\nbecause it\\'s better in the shirt, where no one can see \\nme, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nquestioning me so I can recover. In fact, he pretty \\nmuch leaves me alone until the berries come up. \\n\\n\"Katniss, I know you\\'ve had a shock, but I\\'ve got to \\nask. The moment when you pulled out those berries. \\nWhat was going on in your mind ... hm?\" he says. \\n\\nI take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect \\nmy thoughts. This is the crucial moment where I \\neither challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the \\nidea of losing Peeta that I can\\'t be held responsible for \\nmy actions. It seems to call for a big, dramatic \\nspeech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible \\nsentence. \"I don\\'t know, I just ... couldn\\'t bear the \\nthought of ... being without him.\" \\n\\n\"Peeta? Anything to add?\" asks Caesar. \\n\\n\"No. I think that goes for both of us,\" he says. \\n\\nCaesar signs off and it\\'s over. Everyone\\'s laughing \\nand crying and hugging, but I\\'m still not sure until I \\nreach Haymitch.\"Okay?\" I whisper. \\n\\n\"Perfect,\" he answers. \\n\\nI go back to my room to collect a few things and find \\nthere\\'s nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge \\ngave me. Someone returned it to my room after the \\nGames. They drive us through the streets in a car \\nwith blackened windows, and the train\\'s waiting for \\nus. We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and \\nPortia, although we\\'ll see them in a few months, when \\nwe tour the districts for a round of victory \\nceremonies. It\\'s the Capitol\\'s way of reminding people \\nthat the Hunger Games never really go away. Well be \\ngiven a lot of useless plaques, and everyone will have \\nto pretend they love us. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe train begins moving and we\\'re plunged into night \\nuntil we clear the tunnel and I take my first free \\nbreath since the reaping. Effie is accompanying us \\nback and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an \\nenormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the \\ntelevision to watch a replay of the interview. With the \\nCapitol growing farther away every second, I begin to \\nthink of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I \\nexcuse myself to change out of my dress and into a \\nplain shirt and pants. As I slowly, thoroughly wash \\nthe makeup from my face and put my hair in its \\nbraid, I begin transforming back into myself. Katniss \\nEverdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the \\nwoods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try \\nto remember who I am and who I am not. By the time \\nI join the others, the pressure of Peeta\\'s arm around \\nmy shoulders feels alien. \\n\\nWhen the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we\\'re \\nallowed to go outside for some fresh air. There\\'s no \\nlonger any need to guard us. Peeta and I walk down \\nalong the track, hand in hand, and I can\\'t find \\nanything to say now that we\\'re alone. He stops to \\ngather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he \\npresents them, I work hard to look pleased. Because \\nhe can\\'t know that the pink-and-white flowers are the \\ntops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours \\nI\\'ve spent gathering them with Gale. \\n\\nGale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours \\nmakes my stomach churn. But why? I can\\'t quite \\nframe it in my mind. I only know that I feel like I\\'ve \\nbeen lying to someone who trusts me. Or more \\naccurately, to two people. I\\'ve been getting away with \\nit up to this point because of the Games. But there \\nwill be no Games to hide behind back home. \\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" Peeta asks. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" I answer. We continue walking, past the \\nend of the train, out where even I\\'m fairly sure there \\nare no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along \\nthe track. Still no words come. \\n\\nHaymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my \\nback. Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps \\nhis voice down. \"Great job, you two. Just keep it up in \\nthe district until the cameras are gone. We should be \\nokay.\" I watch him head back to the train, avoiding \\nPeeta\\'s eyes. \\n\\n\"What\\'s he mean?\" Peeta asks me. \\n\\n\"It\\'s the Capitol. They didn\\'t like our stunt with the \\nberries,\" I blurt out. \\n\\n\"What? What are you talking about?\" he says. \\n\\n\"It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been \\ncoaching me through the last few days. So I didn\\'t \\nmake it worse, \"I say. \\n\\n\"Coaching you? But not me,\" says Peeta. \\n\\n\"He knew you were smart enough to get it right,\" I \\nsay. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know there was anything to get right,\" says \\nPeeta. \"So, what you\\'re saying is, these last few days \\nand then I guess . . . back in the arena . . . that was just \\nsome strategy you two worked out.\" \\n\\n\"No. I mean, I couldn\\'t even talk to him in the arena, \\ncould I?\" I stammer. \\n\\n\"But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn\\'t \\nyou?\"says Peeta. I bite my lip. \"Katniss?\" He drops my \\nhand and I take a step, as if to catch my balance. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was all for the Games,\" Peeta says. \"How you \\nacted.\" \\n\\n\"Not all of it,\" I say, tightly holding onto my flowers. \\n\\n\"Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real \\nquestion is what\\'s going to be left when we get home?\" \\nhe says. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the \\nmore confused I get,\" I say. He waits, for further \\nexplanation, but none\\'s forthcoming. \\n\\n\"Well, let me know when you work it out,\" he says, \\nand the pain in his voice is palpable. \\n\\nI know my ears are healed because, even with the \\nrumble of the engine, I can hear every step he takes \\nback to the train. By the time I\\'ve climbed aboard, \\nPeeta has disappeared into his room for the night. I \\ndon\\'t see him the next morning, either. In fact, the \\nnext time he turns up, we\\'re pulling into District 12. \\nHe gives me a nod, his face expressionless. \\n\\nI want to tell him that he\\'s not being fair. That we \\nwere strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to \\nkeep us both alive in the arena. That I can\\'t explain \\nhow things are with Gale because I don\\'t know \\nmyself. That it\\'s no good loving me because I\\'m never \\ngoing to get married anyway and he\\'d just end up \\nhating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have \\nfeelings for him, it doesn\\'t matter because I\\'ll never be \\nable to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to \\nchildren. And how can he? How can he after what \\nwe\\'ve just been through? \\n\\nI also want to tell him how much I already miss him. \\nBut that wouldn\\'t be fair on my part. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSo we just stand there silently, watching our grimy \\nlittle station rise up around us. Through the window, \\nI can see the platform\\'s thick with cameras. Everyone \\nwill be eagerly watching our homecoming. \\n\\nOut of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his \\nhand. I look at him, unsure. \"One more time? For the \\naudience?\" he says. His voice isn\\'t angry. It\\'s hollow, \\nwhich is worse. Already the boy with the bread is \\nslipping away from me. \\n\\nI take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the \\ncameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally \\nhave to let go. \\n\\n\\n\\n'"
